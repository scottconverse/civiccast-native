# Shared "install ffmpeg + tsduck for the media test suites" step for
# hosted-ubuntu CI jobs -- ci-test.yml's `Unit tests` job and
# deterministic-detectors.yml's `randomized-suite` job. Both jobs used to
# carry a near-identical copy of this shell inline; consolidated here so a
# fix lands once instead of drifting between copies.
#
# Two documented hosted-runner failure modes, both bounded below:
#
#   1. unattended-upgrades / apt-daily*.timer holds the dpkg/apt locks on
#      boot. Bare `apt-get` waits on that lock FOREVER: on 2026-08-19 this
#      step sat in_progress for 3h49m on the release branch and ~2h on PRs
#      #422/#423, silently wedging the whole merge queue while every other
#      job showed green.
#   2. The Azure-hosted mirror (azure.archive.ubuntu.com) occasionally
#      serves a handful of packages at a few hundred KB/s instead of its
#      usual multi-MB/s, or the connection itself stalls outright. Confirmed
#      across four independent runs that never touched the dpkg lock at all:
#        - PR #131 "Unit tests" job 100278667553 (libflite1, 13.6 MB,
#          stalled from 14:08:54 past the old 300s per-call bound)
#        - PR #135 "randomized-suite" job 100284786583 (libdav1d7, stalled
#          from 14:20:16 to 14:24:41 -- 4m25s for a 604 kB package)
#        - PR #132 "randomized-suite" job 100287702253 (same pattern)
#        - PR #136 "randomized-suite" job 100314970674, AFTER the 300s->480s
#          per-call raise above: `Get:10 ... libdav1d7 ... [604 kB]` logged
#          at 15:46:13Z, then nothing until the 480s `timeout` killed it at
#          15:50:00Z. `Acquire::Retries` never fired -- it only retries a
#          call that actually fails or completes; a socket that goes silent
#          mid-transfer without erroring or finishing is invisible to it.
#          Fixed by giving apt its own low-level stall detector
#          (Acquire::http::Timeout / Acquire::https::Timeout) so a silent
#          connection aborts in 30s and the retry logic actually gets a
#          chance to run, plus a mirror-swap fallback in case the Azure
#          mirror itself is the problem rather than one bad connection.
#
# Bound both causes: stop the background upgrader before touching apt, wait
# for the dpkg/apt locks with a visible bounded loop, bound the network at
# both the per-call and per-connection level, fall back to a different
# mirror if the primary one is unhealthy, and give the whole step enough
# headroom to survive a slow mirror -- but not forever. On failure, dump
# what's still holding apt/dpkg so the next failure is diagnosable from the
# log alone.
