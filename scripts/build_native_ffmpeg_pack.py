r"""Build the signed native ``native-ffmpeg-runtime`` component pack: the
FFmpeg COMMAND-LINE tools (``ffmpeg.exe`` + ``ffprobe.exe``) and the minimal
set of FFmpeg shared libraries they actually import.

The gap this closes: the native bootstrap install ships NO ``ffmpeg.exe`` or
``ffprobe.exe`` at all. ``scripts/verify_native_runtime_closure.py`` says so
in its own words ("the packaged tree ships no `ffmpeg.exe`, so a decode check
built around shelling out to one can never pass"), yet the five-pack
activation path REQUIRES ``dependencies/ffmpeg/bin/ffmpeg.exe``
(``native_activation.rs``'s ``validate_staged_runtime_layout``, and
``main.rs``'s staged-runtime self-test, which runs that exact path with
``-version``). Nothing built the artifact that satisfies those pins. This
script is that builder.

Mirrors ``scripts/build_native_server_pack.py``'s conventions exactly --
pinned-input validation before packing, ``--acquire`` reusing the ALREADY
REVIEWED ``native-windows-runtime-dependencies.lock.json`` and its
``fetch_locked_artifact``/``safe_extract_zip`` primitives verbatim, a signed
ZIP64 pack via ``build_native_pack``, a development-signing-key guard, a
``--report`` JSON, and a LIVE build-time proof that the exact packed
selection works before any pack is written.

## Payload layout, and why it is ``bin/``-rooted

``native_pack_staging::pack_extraction_destination`` maps this component to
``<INSTDIR>\dependencies\ffmpeg`` (the same per-component bridge
``native-app-payload`` already uses to reach ``<INSTDIR>\runtime``). Rooting
the payload at ``bin/`` therefore lands ``ffmpeg.exe`` at exactly
``<INSTDIR>\dependencies\ffmpeg\bin\ffmpeg.exe`` -- the convention
``native_activation.rs`` already pins, reached without inventing a second
path anywhere.

## Minimization

BtbN's ``win64-lgpl-shared`` archive is a general-purpose SDK distribution:
223 files / ~175.9 MB extracted, of which ~32.5 MB is developer material this
product can never execute (C headers under ``include/``, import libraries and
``.def``/``.pc`` files under ``lib/``, the full HTML manual under ``doc/``,
libvpx encoder presets) plus ``ffplay.exe`` (~17.9 MB), an interactive SDL
media player nothing in this repository invokes. This builder ships only the
PE closure of the two executables the product actually shells out to,
determined by a REAL recursive ``pefile`` import-table walk (ordinary AND
delay-load directories) -- the same method
``scripts/build_native_runtime_closure.py`` uses for the media closure, and
the same method ``build_native_server_pack.py``'s DLL pins were derived by.
See ``FFMPEG_BIN_PINS`` for the exact resulting file set.

## LGPL obligations

Follows ``build_native_server_pack.py``'s pattern exactly: the verbatim
upstream license text is packed at ``licenses/ffmpeg/LICENSE.txt``, a
generated ``notices/ffmpeg-runtime.txt`` records the exact upstream build
identity plus the corresponding-source offer, and
``_require_zero_gpl_and_full_license_provenance`` refuses to build if ANY
packed path lacks confirmed provenance in
``civiccast.native.runtime_licenses`` or resolves to a GPL-family license.

    """Live build-time proof that the EXACT nine-file selection this builder
    packs can run, encode, and probe -- from a tree containing ONLY those nine
    files, laid out the way the installer will lay them out.

    This is the FFmpeg analogue of ``build_native_server_pack.
    prove_postgres_bootstrap``, and it exists for the same reason: no
    hash/path-set validation can catch a minimization that dropped a DLL the
    binary only needs at run time. The only authority on completeness is the
    binary itself. Every real pack build therefore materializes the selected
    files into a scratch ``dependencies/ffmpeg/bin`` tree and runs, in order:

      1. ``ffmpeg.exe -version`` and ``ffprobe.exe -version`` -- the SAME
         probe ``main.rs``'s staged-runtime self-test runs against
         ``dependencies/ffmpeg/bin/ffmpeg.exe``.
      2. ``ffmpeg.exe -L``, asserting the binary's OWN license self-report
         names the LESSER GPL and not the plain GNU General Public License.
         The owner-settled no-GPL constraint is thereby checked against the
         artifact, not merely against the archive's filename.
      3. A real 2-second ``testsrc``+``sine`` H.264/AAC encode -- the same
         shape ``civiccast.installer.service._write_sample_video`` produces
         for the rehearsal path -- followed by an ``ffprobe`` of the result,
         asserting a real ``h264`` video stream and a real ``aac`` audio
         stream came back out.

    Any failing step fails the BUILD with that step's full output -- never a
    station install. ``run`` is injectable for the unit suite (no real FFmpeg
    execution in unit tests; the live execution happens on every real CLI pack
    build).

    Returns the collected evidence (versions, the license line, the encoded
    file's size, and the probe's stream summary) so ``--report`` can carry it.

    ENCODER NOTE, deliberately not papered over: this build is configured
    ``--disable-libx264`` (libx264 is GPL, so it cannot appear in an LGPL
    FFmpeg), and the proof therefore encodes with ``libopenh264`` -- the
    BSD-2-Clause H.264 encoder this build DOES carry. Product call sites use a
    declarative H.264 request; ``civiccast.stream._ffmpeg`` probes the exact
    binary and resolves NVENC -> Media Foundation -> OpenH264 (-> libx264
    strictly last, never present in this LGPL pack) immediately
    before execution. The pack proof pins its software encoder explicitly so
    it remains a hardware-independent closure check.
