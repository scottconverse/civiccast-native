"""Build the CivicCast (Native) unsigned installer `.exe` with the verified
runtime closure embedded (WP-4 Part B — the D2 build-time half).

This is the reproducible path from the hash-pinned wheel set to a native NSIS
installer whose bundle carries the audited runtime tree. It does NOT sign
(signing is a later WP; the `.exe` is unsigned here by design) and it never
commits the 75 MB payload — the staging directory is git-ignored, and this
script is the way to (re)produce it.

Pipeline:

  1. **Build the closure.** Reuse `scripts.build_native_runtime_closure.build`
     verbatim — stage the pinned wheels (`requirements-native-runtime.txt`),
     walk the real PE import closure, copy the SHARED-CONTRACT tree, bundle the
     license notices + texts, and emit the trust artifacts
     (`runtime-manifest.json`, `SHA256SUMS`, `LICENSE-BOM.md`).
  2. **Verify the freshly built tree against its manifest — byte for byte,
     fail loud.** Reuse `scripts.verify_native_runtime_closure.check_manifest_verification`,
     which independently re-hashes every on-disk file and diffs it against
     `runtime-manifest.json`, and also proves `SHA256SUMS` / `LICENSE-BOM.md`
     match what the manifest implies. A FAIL aborts before anything is staged.
  3. **Stage the verified tree into the native installer's bundle resources.**
     Clean-copy the whole tree (trust artifacts included) into
     `<installer>/src-tauri/native-runtime/`, which the native Tauri config
     binds as `bundle.resources` so it lands INSIDE the bundle per D2.
  4. **Re-verify the STAGED copy against the manifest — fail loud.** This is
     the D2 assurance that the bytes about to be embedded are the audited bytes
     (the manifest's own integrity, once signed, chains to Authenticode).
  5. **`tauri build --config src-tauri/tauri.native.conf.json`** (unsigned) to
     produce the native NSIS setup `.exe`.

Each stage is individually skippable (`--skip-closure-build` to reuse a tree,
`--stage-only` to stop before the Tauri build) so the heavy Rust/NSIS build can
be run — or its failure reported — independently of the closure build.
