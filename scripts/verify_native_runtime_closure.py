"""D6 acceptance verification suite (AC2): proves a BUILT packaged tree is
self-sufficient.

`spec-packaging-closure` D6 requires this to run against the packaged tree
ONLY, inside a child process launched with a deliberately hostile
environment: PATH scrubbed to system directories plus `<tree>/bin`, plugin
search paths pointed exclusively at the tree, a fresh-per-run
`GST_REGISTRY` (never the caller's cached registry -- a stale registry is
exactly how you get a false green), and `GST_PLUGIN_SYSTEM_PATH` forced
empty so the operating system's own GStreamer install (if any) cannot be
loaded from instead of the tree.

Five checks, each PASS/FAIL/SKIPPED:

  1. Factory sweep -- every `REQUIRED_FACTORIES` entry resolves via
     `Gst.ElementFactory.find`. `mfh264enc`/`mfh265enc`/`nvh264enc`/
     `nvh265enc` register only on matching hardware/drivers, so a miss is
     split into two independent questions before it is ever excused: (a) is
     the PLUGIN FILE present in the tree (`FACTORY_PLUGIN[name]` under
     `<tree>/lib/gstreamer-1.0`) -- a packaging question, ALWAYS a hard FAIL
     when absent, for every required factory, hardware-gated or not; and
     (b) does the FACTORY register on this machine -- a hardware question,
     excused as HARDWARE-GATED only when the plugin file is genuinely
     present. A required factory whose plugin DLL is entirely missing from
     the tree is therefore always a genuine miss, never silently folded
     into a hardware-gated pass.
  2. Plugin origin check -- every loaded plugin's backing file is inside
     the tree. A plugin loaded from outside is a hard FAIL (AC5).
  3. Caption leg -- embeds CEA-608 captions into H.264 (modeled on
     `.agent-runs/native-windows/spike-gstreamer-bundle/evidence/
     run_caption_pipeline.py`) and decodes them back USING ONLY ELEMENTS
     THE PACKAGED TREE CONTAINS -- the tree deliberately ships no
     `ffmpeg.exe`, so decode-back runs entirely in GStreamer:
     `tsdemux` -> `h264parse` -> `h264ccextractor` (pulls the CEA-708 SEI
     back out of the H.264 stream) -> `ccconverter` (CEA-708 -> CEA-608) ->
     `cea608tott` (CEA-608 -> plain/WebVTT text) -> `appsink`. This is a
     genuine text content round trip, not a meta-presence stand-in: the
     probe text is asserted as a substring of the decoded text.
  4. GPL negative control (AC3) -- `x264enc`/`x265enc` are absent both as
     files under `lib/gstreamer-1.0` and as resolvable factories.
  5. Manifest verification -- delegates to
     `civiccast.native.runtime_manifest.verify_manifest` (owned by another
     WS5 worker). If that module does not exist yet, this check reports
     SKIPPED with the ImportError text rather than reimplementing it.

Checks 1-3 and 4's factory half run inside the hostile child process
(anything that touches `gi`/`Gst` must run there, never in this process,
so the parent's own environment can never leak in). Check 4's file half and
check 5 are plain filesystem/hashing operations and run directly in the
parent -- no GStreamer involved, no need to pay the child-process cost.

CLI: ``--tree <dir>`` (required), ``--json <path>`` (optional). Exit code 0
only if every non-skipped check passed.

# D2(d) -- dynamic file-access trace
#
# The static PE-import walk cannot see what a process opens at RUNTIME: a
# plugin that calls LoadLibrary, a library that reads a data file by absolute
# path, a codec that falls back to a system copy of itself. The spec's D2(d)
# requires the D6 suite to run under a file-access trace and fail the build on
# anything loaded from outside the tree. Without it, a package can pass every
# other check and still depend on something that is not in the box (Codex r1
# finding CC-WS5-PKG-001, Blocker).
#
# The spec suggests "procmon boot-log or equivalent". Procmon needs a kernel
# driver and therefore Administrator, which this build path deliberately does
# not have. This is the equivalent, built from two in-process mechanisms that
# need no privilege:
#
#   1. A CPython audit hook (`sys.addaudithook`). Installed before ANY media
#      code is imported, it sees `open`, `os.open`, `os.listdir`, `glob.glob`
#      and -- critically -- `ctypes.dlopen`, which is how a native library gets
#      pulled in dynamically.
#   2. A loaded-module enumeration taken after the suite has run, which reports
#      every module actually mapped into the process, whatever loaded it and
#      whether or not Python ever saw the call.
#
# HONEST LIMITS, stated rather than papered over: (1) catches Python-mediated
# access and dlopen but not a file opened purely inside native code via
# CreateFileW; (2) catches every module still mapped at the end but would miss
# one loaded and unloaded mid-run. Together they cover the dominant closure
# risk -- a library resolved from outside the tree -- and neither is a
# substitute for a kernel trace, which is why this says "equivalent", not
# "procmon".

       dependencies (pydantic, psutil, pytest machinery) are not the product.
       They appear only because importing `civiccast.native.runtime_closure`
       executes the package `__init__`, which pulls in app dependencies the
       packaging tool does not need -- a real coupling, recorded as a follow-up,
       but not a closure defect.
    3. GPU shader caches. The graphics driver WRITES these during a real encode;
       they are driver-managed cache artifacts, not code loaded into the
       process.

    Deliberately NOT permitted: anything under `Program Files\\WindowsApps`.

    loaded from there is a genuine runtime dependency the operator's machine may
