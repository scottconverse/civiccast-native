"""Fail if any workflow job can run without a ceiling.

Why this gate exists
--------------------
On 2026-08-19/20 four separate CI wedges cost hours of blocked merge queue,
and every one of them was the same defect: a step or job with no ceiling.

  * ``apt-get`` with no dpkg-lock timeout sat 3h49m on the release branch and
    ~2h on PRs #422 and #423 (runs 32294685985, 32303353858, 32303185157).
  * ``assemble-native-beta-kit`` declared no ``timeout-minutes`` at all, so it
    inherited GitHub's 360-minute default and sat over an hour inside a hung
    ``actions/download-artifact`` (run 32316394055).
  * A pinned model download with no retry killed the whole installable-kit
    build on one dropped socket (run 32314864434).

The common shape is worse than "slow": a wedged job reports **no failing
checks**. The PR sits BLOCKED behind something that will never finish, and
failure-only monitoring calls it clean. It is invisible until someone asks
why nothing has merged.

A promise not to do it again is not a control. This is the control: a job
without a declared ceiling fails the build, so the default can never be
inherited silently again.

Rules
-----
1. Every job must declare ``timeout-minutes``. Jobs that only ``uses:`` a
   reusable workflow are exempt -- the ceiling belongs to that workflow's own
   jobs, where this same check enforces it.
2. No job may exceed ``MAX_MINUTES`` unless it is in ``LONG_BY_DESIGN`` with a
   written reason. The allowlist is the place to argue for an exception; a
   bare large number is not.
3. Every ``actions/upload-artifact`` and ``actions/download-artifact`` step
   must declare its own ``timeout-minutes``. A job ceiling alone is not
   enough here: this repo's artifacts are enormous (the native station bundle
   is 18.6 GB, the assembled kit 21.9 GB), a healthy upload of that bundle
   takes ~12 minutes, and on 2026-08-20 run 32319075421 sat 50+ minutes on
   that exact step. Without a step ceiling the only thing that eventually
   stops a hung transfer is the job ceiling -- hours later.
