# Current checkpoint: October 19, 2026 - installed CG ticker rendering correction

Branch fix/beta19-ci-and-install-docs, PR259. Signed dc820a86/build39279693859
installed successfully in the isolated station with five original API inventory
hashes preserved. Applicable Windows CI39279691301 attempt2 passed; a6211c7d is
the subsequent test-format-only checkpoint. Native-ID CG approval now passes.

Actual ticker preview failed with text-omitted. A diagnostic using the installed
renderer captured FFmpeg rejecting the unquoted comma in the horizontal scroll
expression. The source now quotes that expression. Existing compositor baseline:
24 passed. The new real-FFmpeg regression failed before the fix with the same
filter-parse error; the affected module then passed 25 tests. Replacement signed
packaging and installed confirmation are required; no replacement build is
claimed here.

Three real 220-second HLS captures decoded with video/audio; live captions and
populated as-run reports were observed. Caption transcription errors remain, and
the 30-second schedule exercised the short-tail skipping policy rather than
proving both intended programs. New recording capture/stop completed with zero
reported dropouts. CG output, remaining workflows/federation, same-kit reinstall,
real host backup and host upgrade remain unresolved. Production remains Beta19;
no host reboot or publication. Workspace CIVICCAST-CURRENT-WORK.md is the single
remaining-work list, with exact scope/evidence in replacement-candidate-dc820a86.

# Historical checkpoint: October 19, 2026 - CG approval correction

Branch fix/beta19-ci-and-install-docs, PR259. Base source fe7dc1df3b6543794af13f2ea0fc1b1a38eeabf9 contains the reload correction. The additional CG approval route fix is included with this checkpoint; exact resulting SHA and new build run are recorded in the PR and workspace candidate continuation after dispatch. Earlier checkpoints below are historical.

Installed51c fetched32 BBC RSS items successfully, but Approve returned404 for a native URL ID. The route now accepts slash-bearing IDs without changing service ownership or role checks. Four focused cases failed before the correction; focused5 and affected22 cases passed afterward. Independent source review found no blocker. Ruff and generated OpenAPI artifact check passed. The generated contract and existing operator steps are unchanged. No installed acceptance of this correction is claimed.

The preceding signed build39276071513 was requested cancelled because it lacks this shipped correction; its observation/download and CI-retry watchers were stopped. No replacement dispatch is claimed in this source checkpoint. Installed CG editing/fetching, empty-period affidavit downloads, Web/PWA build/download, real alert transport and existing unmuted recording playback have scoped passes. Corrected three-channel program run, remaining walkthrough/features, isolated reinstall, real recovery backup and host upgrade remain outstanding. Host unchanged; no reboot or publication. All nine owner outcomes remain required.
# Current checkpoint: October 19, 2026 - installed reload failure

Branch fix/beta19-ci-and-install-docs; current HEAD 51c886874ea7eeb53457604c1a0ce9689312f543; draft PR259. Exact signed build39257884570 and CI39257879140 succeeded. Verified kit installed in isolated CivicCast-Beta16-Verification with setup exit0, registration0, healthy schema0094 and restricted service identity. Five API collection hashes match preinstall. All three initial HLS playlists and segments returned200. This resolves the installer working-directory failure described below.

The committed three-channel program run failed: after two queued reloads, replacement slate workers remained TRANSITIONING and missed scheduled programming. Captures finished; inspected government frame shows slate; active caption VTTs have no cues. A direct executable reproduction traced stale pending-reload and deliberate-kill state surviving a direct start past a dead worker. Focused source correction is in progress; no new signed build yet. Workspace evidence: outputs/replacement-candidate-51c88687/vm-check/transition-diagnostic. Installed underwriting/app-download confirmation is running separately.

All nine owner outcomes remain required. Host unchanged; no reboot or publication. Host upgrade requires isolated acceptance and a verified usable recovery backup; the actual backup has not run. Prior evidence below is historical, not acceptance of the current candidate.
# Current checkpoint: October 19, 2026 — installer working-directory correction

Branch `fix/beta19-ci-and-install-docs`, draft PR 259. Signed source
`8717c2a2c476e1fd563f1a865a1a1837b4abcb01` built successfully in run
39241295587. Test-only follow-up `191ee02c47ced570c58f5412d013714bdb0d1a56`
passed CI39243436914. The assembled kit passed signature/hash/index/manual
verification. Its isolated installation nevertheless failed registration70/setup118.
Automatic recovery returned0 at October19 06:57:57 MDT, restoring the guest
healthy/Running/Auto with current schema0094 and the restricted service identity.
Five APIcollection hashes match baseline; no raw-media preservation claim.

Focused diagnosis: full registration with the signed identity module succeeds
from outside the installation directory, including with the installer transaction
environment. Changing registration cwd to the installroot reproduces70/CreateFile32
on the directory permission walk. The pinned Tauri2.11.2 template sets OUTDIR to
INSTDIR before POSTINSTALL. Temporarily switching OUTDIR to PLUGINSDIR for the
child releases parent and inherited-child cwd handles while preserving the ACL
algorithm. Restore OUTDIR before branching; retain bounded child diagnostics in
the persistent progress log. The compiled NSIS regression passed for child exits0/70; all47 affected hook tests passed. Independent source review found no blocker.
This is a shipped-installer correction: a new exact-source signed candidate and
isolated installation acceptance are required. Diagnostic passes are not acceptance.

Evidence: workspace outputs/replacement-candidate-8717c2a2/vm-check/replacement-install,
including result.json, full-registration-diagnostic.json,
transaction-registration-diagnostic.json, cwd-registration-diagnostic.json,
and diagnostic-decision.md. All nine outcomes remain active. Host unchanged;
no host upgrade until isolated acceptance plus verified usable recovery backup,
no reboot, no publication, no new soak. Earlier checkpoints below are historical.

## Earlier checkpoint — superseded where updated above
# Current checkpoint: October 19, 2026 — running-image registration correction

Branch `fix/beta19-ci-and-install-docs`, draft PR 259. Signed source
7ad7b44d7604b508d5834907b42e3f527e99bbee built successfully in run 39224848934;
CI 39224839230 passed after one retry for an external Chocolatey HTTP 503.
The complete kit passed signature/hash/index/manual checks. Its isolated install
failed registration 70/setup 118. Automatic recovery returned 0 and restored the
prior guest healthy/Running/Auto. Five API collection hashes match pre-install.
The host remains unchanged. Do not call this candidate accepted.

Captured diagnosis: the exact candidate identity module succeeds from an external
interpreter but fails CreateFile error 32 on loaded runtime/_asyncio.pyd when invoked
through the installed interpreter inside the permission tree. MAXIMUM_ALLOWED
requests unnecessary file access incompatible with running images. The correction
retains MAXIMUM_ALLOWED for recursive directories (preventing child propagation)
and requests READ_CONTROL|WRITE_DAC for files. Root/ancestor redirection refusal,
pruned descendants, protected ACLs and ordinary root-only inheritance remain.

A regression runs a copied Python interpreter inside its own grant tree: RED on
7ad logic, GREEN with the correction. All 15 focused Windows tests pass. Independent
review found no material issue. A hash-bound corrected-source overlay also passed
identity configuration through the guest's installed interpreter; guest restarted
healthy. This is source/diagnostic proof, not corrected signed-installer acceptance.
Original silent-installer stderr was not retained; no claim it was recovered.

The added Windows regression changes collection to 2029 pure/2271 total/2268 Windows
non-integration; Windows floor 2218 preserves its 50-test margin. Six workflow blob
bindings are refreshed, retaining historical claims evidence. A new exact-source
signed build and installed check are still required because shipped code changed.

All nine owner outcomes remain active: corrected installation and walkthrough,
bounded three-channel and changed-feature acceptance, isolated uninstall/reinstall,
then verified host recovery backup before host upgrade. No host reboot, publication,
new soak, or interrupted-install project. Evidence: workspace
outputs/replacement-candidate-7ad7b44d/vm-check/replacement-install and
outputs/running-image-acl-review.md; continuity outputs/CIVICCAST-CURRENT-WORK.md.
## Test-only CI follow-up

The 8717c2a2 Windows CI job 118022447733 passed 2267 native cases but the new
running-image fixture failed before product code with exit 106, `No pyvenv.cfg file`:
it copied a virtual-environment launcher. The fixture now copies CPython's base
executable, exposes the existing pywin32 support-DLL directory, and asserts the
child runs that copied image inside the grant tree. All 15 cases pass under the
project virtual environment; forcing old file-access behavior still fails with error 32.
This changes tests only: preserve signed source 8717c2a2/build 39241295587.

The optional integration job failed a public Legistar disconnect; the exact live
test subsequently passed locally. Fresh CI for the fixture correction includes
that job, so the pending old-job retry was cancelled before submission. Normal
workflow concurrency supersedes the old failing CI; its unfinished unit result
must not be called a pass. No signed rebuild is required for this follow-up.
## Earlier checkpoint (superseded where updated above)

# Current work: Beta 20 installed verification active (October 18, 2026)

Current branch: `fix/beta19-ci-and-install-docs`. The preserved walkthrough
corrections were consolidated, followed by the reload correction at
`267b463501f6188aef7296d064503c87aaccde8d`. Its Windows CI job
`117905315945` passed, including real native media and installer cases.
The initial Beta 20 signed candidate `823ba47779174551d4dd249abf1f3241193a8e4f`
was built by workflow `39082353577` and installed successfully in the isolated
Hyper-V guest. Its actual three-channel output failed at encoder bootstrap.
Signed preparation runs `39203072265` and `39204756180` were cancelled after
further shipped-code defects were confirmed; neither is the final candidate.
The latest correction protects alert credentials and subscription masterkeys
before writing plaintext and migrates existing files without rotating keys.
A restricted-token synthetic read proved the prior Windows ACL exposure.
A new signed kit and corrected-installation regression checks remain required.
Do not restart completed installation or walkthrough work based on the
historical checkpoint below.

Read current progress and decisions in
`C:\Users\scott\Documents\Codex\2026-10-18\re\outputs\CIVICCAST-CURRENT-WORK.md`.
Prior detailed installed evidence remains under
`C:\Users\scott\Documents\Codex\2026-10-04\rea\outputs\sprint6-installed-verification-2026-10-17\vm-check`.
The owner resumed all nine outcomes: consolidate/build, installed fixes and
walkthrough, bounded three-channel and changed-feature operation, isolated
uninstall/reinstall, verified host backup, then host upgrade and final report.
The host remains Beta 19; no host cutover has occurred. No release publication, new soak,
or host reboot. TownLight stays deferred to 2.0.

The old installed guest passed actual webhook ownership confirmation, signed
delivery and automatic retry after a deliberate HTTP 503. This remains old-
candidate evidence and needs a corrected-installation confirmation. Host
inventory and complete recovery-backup preparation exist; the backup has not
run. Isolated three-channel output, final lifecycle verification and host
upgrade are not accepted yet.

## Historical October 17 source checkpoint (superseded by the above)

Read the compaction handoff:
`C:\Users\scott\Documents\Codex\2026-10-04\rea\outputs\CIVICCAST-COMPACTION-HANDOFF-2026-10-17.md`.
Source/docs checks are complete, but the user requires a consolidated candidate,
clean install/uninstall/reinstall, full control-by-control walkthrough and then
upgrade/verification of this host's existing three-channel station. None of those
new candidate checks has started. No host reboot, new soak or publication.

Sprint 6 documentation item 12 was reopened and corrected: [scope and status](docs/ops/sprint6.md). The earlier blanket completion claim was incorrect; the [October 17 correction receipt](docs/ops/manual-reconciliation-2026-10-17.md) records final source/Help/PDF/Word checks. It adds the remaining
webhook, Roku and documentation corrections to preparation improvements,
hardware-aware encoding, architectural assessment and CivicCast multi-station
integration. The owner selected both catalog sharing and central station management.
This is source work, not a new published package or production cutover.
The earlier skipped-test coverage corrections remain in the working tree.

Items 12, 16, 21–25 have source corrections/assessment and focused evidence.
Item 26's catalog sharing and central channel controls are implemented and
reviewed. The owner renamed CivicSuite to TownLight and deferred ALL suite
integration, including TownLight: Station, to 2.0 on October 17. It is not a
Sprint 6 blocker or an implemented feature. Detailed results and limits
are in the Sprint 6 record above. No package build or production cutover occurred.

## Published Beta 19 record (2026-10-15)

Publication branch was `main`. Read current branch and HEAD from Git.
Current published tag: `v1.0.0-beta.19`.
PR #257: https://github.com/scottconverse/civiccast-native/pull/257;
merge/tag target `b5204750bd96986dcde1adadffc0fe4b4e81f695`.
Current source includes Sprint 5 remote-guest composition and relay
commissioning, bulletin-board live video and audio, and native viewer
completion, along with the earlier Beta 17/18 publication/import work.
Beta 19's signed kit was built from
`7d61cbede3123a65b4a0d6d4b413ae99edbc3f04` in
[workflow 38797808863](https://github.com/scottconverse/civiccast-native/actions/runs/38797808863).
Its package identity and scoped checks are in the
[Beta 19 verification record](docs/releases/v1.0.0-beta.19-verification.md).
The [public Beta 19 release](https://github.com/scottconverse/civiccast-native/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.19)
has 26 verified assets. The exact package has no fresh-install, upgrade,
uninstall or extended-soak result; those outcomes remain for later evaluation.
The historical Beta 17 record below is retained for attribution.

## Beta 17 release (2026-10-15)

[PR #251](https://github.com/scottconverse/civiccast-native/pull/251) merged as
`4a5804608c38774bc04b4c2a5c6f34f56ebdea26`, the Beta 17 tag target.
The signed installer was built from `597b97fd21ad1e9e5fd52bb399f81214ffdb88f0`.
The [Beta 17 release](https://github.com/scottconverse/civiccast-native/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.17)
and [package record](docs/releases/v1.0.0-beta.17-verification.md) identify
its assets and scoped checks.

Completed Sprint 5 source work covers subscriber notices with receipts and
retries, Podcast MP3 enclosures and RSS, and saved
underwriting daypart selection. Sprint 5 remote-guest composition,
bulletin-board media, station-import UI, and native viewer completion remain
open. Protected paywall media remains deferred. The signed package's
installation checks passed; its Windows Sandbox product-engine stream capture
did not. The exact result is in the package record. Historical Beta 16 results
below belong only to Beta 16.

At Beta 17, the source brought together station operations, unattended scheduling,
broadcast output, programme transitions, HLS retention, and recorded-caption
work. Signed `v1.0.0-beta.17` was that edition's [published release](https://github.com/scottconverse/civiccast-native/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.17); the
[package verification record](docs/releases/v1.0.0-beta.17-verification.md)
identifies its installer and checks.

PR #249 merged to `main` as `efcab4c1f618e4a46bf62491ee410a9fcd9e7618`, the Beta 16 tag target.
The signed Beta 16 package was built from
`e92bebd4b5289dce969f81b72515cfa0d45eba55`, successful
[build 38635220200](https://github.com/scottconverse/civiccast-native/actions/runs/38635220200).
The corrected package passed upgrade, administrator/profile preservation,
restricted service/process identity, installed GStreamer smoke, and uninstall
in the 240 GiB Hyper-V guest. Clean fresh installation also passed, including
new administrator setup, healthy/current Beta 16, restricted process ownership
and installed runtime smoke. The owner subsequently authorized publication.
The earlier candidate used
`9b83d7b89cddc987fbbcc5e23a1433339810d5d6` on `codex/beta16-release`,
[build 38579665236](https://github.com/scottconverse/civiccast-native/actions/runs/38579665236).
That candidate failed upgrade service registration in the replacement 160 GiB
Hyper-V guest and restored healthy Beta 15 with the saved station profile.
The corrected source stops the service before migrating its identity.
Results are tracked in the package verification record above.

Current source work includes:

- [Station operations](docs/ops/station-operations-goal.md): encrypted backup and restore, supported network setup, staff accounts and sessions, and restricted Windows service identity.
- [Sprint 2](docs/ops/sprint2-unattended.md): station-local recurrence, bounded operational storage, low-disk handling, and recovery after repeated output failures.
- [Sprint 3](docs/ops/sprint3-output-completion.md): RTMP output, per-output audio processing, complete programme endings, coordinated HLS retention, and recorded-caption settings.
- Updated product guidance for the combined source edition; see the [roadmap](docs/ROADMAP.md).

The previous [CivicCast Beta 15 release](https://github.com/scottconverse/civiccast-native/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.15), published October 13, 2026, retains its exact package identity and scoped results in the [Beta 15 verification record](docs/releases/v1.0.0-beta.15-verification.md).

The Beta 15 R9 field report recorded scheduled speech appearing as slate, a CG
playlist referring to missing segments, an unsigned installed native
executable, and a trimmed-caption range mismatch. Its causes and incomplete
workflows remain bounded as described in the [Beta 17 deferred
backlog](docs/ops/beta17-deferred.md). The owner deferred those follow-ups
until after Beta 16 is released. They are not Beta 16 package results.

Historical source merges remain traceable through [PR #245](https://github.com/scottconverse/civiccast-native/pull/245), [PR #246](https://github.com/scottconverse/civiccast-native/pull/246), and [PR #247](https://github.com/scottconverse/civiccast-native/pull/247). Their sprint records preserve contemporaneous implementation evidence and limitations.

## Historical Beta 14 publication handoff

The following is retained history, not the current station or work status.

Beta 14 is published: https://github.com/scottconverse/civiccast-native/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.14
Published 2026-10-12 10:25:01 UTC. All 26 assets passed name/size and SHA-256
digest verification. Six actual public downloads matched SHA-256; the
downloaded installer has a Valid Scott Converse Authenticode signature.

Signed source: `44525c14265d21ae461c2435d4d5a9a6acd58af3`; build `38217950172`.
Release target / merged PR 240: `ed2f5069004abb6c3c6b4375ac82a07fcabe9a7b`.
Installer SHA: `e22d1cb9ae064841c45bed64a37e8ce9bd1e5176e0ff80945edccc362447082f`.
Bookkeeping branch: `codex/beta14-publication-record`.

All 28 requested product goals have focused evidence in
[task completion](docs/ops/beta14-task-completion.md). Exact package passed
fresh offline Sandbox installation, five three-channel observations and
installed Help inspection. Sandbox closed. Same installer ran once on host,
exited 0, and passed component verification and two three-channel observations.
Host remains running: Whistle primary, H.264/AAC, advancing HLS and captions.
No extended Beta 14 soak requested or claimed. Original observer failures are
preserved; corrections did not rerun setup or rebuild the signed application.
Final receipt: `outputs/beta14-work/host-runtime-final/consumer-evidence-receipt.json`.
Raw pre-install snapshot was not retained; account/schedule rows not compared.
Historical R9 TSDuck cause and one unavailable recording segment cause remain
unknown; focused current fixes are evidenced separately.

D: kit: `D:\CivicCast-Beta14-Kit-44525c14`, 19 members, 26,916,076,058 bytes.
Assembly and USB receipts alongside; both installation prompts name Beta 14.
Assembly SHA: `2338fddc987b4cb73bfbea4947901899a11ef0338231b24772f2a756604f77a4`.
Redundant closed Sandbox expansion and twelve uploaded archive parts removed;
evidence/component manifest and working C:/D: kits retained. C: free 403.9 GB.

Goal ACTIVE until this final record lands and live Pages verification finishes.
Only owner may pause. Publisher session 8097 finished; do not restart/build.
Next: land reconciliation, verify live landing page, then mark goal complete.
72-hour/three-channel/99.78% result remains Beta 11 history.
Live release-truth alarm has 17 absent historical releases, none Beta 14.
Preserve unrelated `ops/beta10-oversight/evidence/`.
