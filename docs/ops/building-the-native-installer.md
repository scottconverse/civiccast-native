# Building the native Windows installer

How to build `CivicCast (Native)_<version>_x64-setup.exe` on a Windows
workstation, and what currently stops that build from finishing.

Nothing in this repository documented this before. Every step below was
recovered by reading `.github/workflows/native-beta-candidate-artifacts.yml`
and running it, so it is a record of what actually happens rather than what
was intended.

**Status: the build does not complete.** Stages 1–3 pass; stage 4 fails on a
reproducibility pin. See "Where it stops" at the end — that section is the
point of this document, not an aside.

## What builds what

| Script | Produces |
| --- | --- |
| `scripts/provision_native_build_toolchain.py` | the reviewed node / npm / python / uv, and the reviewed MSVC Build Tools |
| `scripts/build_native_runtime_closure.py` | the GStreamer runtime tree (221 files) |
| `scripts/build_native_pyav_wheel.py` | the LGPL-only PyAV wheel, compiled from source |
| `scripts/build_native_app_payload.py` | the application payload tree |
| `scripts/build_native_installer.py` | the **unsigned** installer `.exe`, orchestrating all of the above |

Signing is separate and needs the owner's credentials — see "Signing".

## Prerequisites

* 64-bit Windows.
* Git, and a checkout with a **clean working tree**. `build_native_app_payload`
  refuses a dirty source: release payloads require a reproducible checkout.
  (`--allow-dirty-source` exists for explicitly non-release proof builds.)
* About 3 GB of free disk for the toolchain, plus ~1 GB of build trees.
* Nothing else. The reviewed toolchain is downloaded and hash-verified; it does
  not use, and does not modify, any Visual Studio already on the machine.

## 1. Provision the reviewed toolchain

```powershell
python -I -B scripts/provision_native_build_toolchain.py `
  --cache  "$env:TEMP\civiccast-toolchain-cache" `
  --output build\wp1-native-toolchain `
  --msvc-install "C:\ccmsvc"
```

Every byte is pinned by SHA-256 in `native-windows-build-toolchain.lock.json`.
On success it prints the verified identities: node `v24.15.0`, npm `11.12.1`,
python `3.12.13`, uv `0.11.15`, and MSVC compiler `19.50.35730`.

Two things that will waste your time otherwise:

* **`--output` must be empty or absent.** It refuses a non-empty directory.
* **`--msvc-install` must be a NEW directory, not an existing Visual Studio.**
  Point it at your installed VS and the script verifies *that* compiler and
  rejects it — e.g. `MSVC compiler is not reviewed 19.50.35730: ... Version
  19.44.35228`. Given a fresh path it downloads the pinned
  `vs_BuildTools-18.5.2.exe` and installs a self-contained copy there.
  Keep the path short: Microsoft's installer rejects a full path of 80
  characters or more, *after* downloading the product.

## 2. Cache the pinned payload interpreter

The payload embeds CPython 3.12.10 (the **embeddable** package, which is not
the same binary as a normal 3.12.10 install):

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest `
  -Uri "https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.12.10/python-3.12.10-embed-amd64.zip" `
  -OutFile "build\native-app-cache\python-3.12.10-embed-amd64.zip"
```

Reviewed identity: 11,133,606 bytes, SHA-256
`4acbed6dd1c744b0376e3b1cf57ce906f9dc9e95e68824584c8099a63025a3c3`.

## 3. Build

Order matters, and getting it wrong fails late and confusingly.

```powershell
$toolchain = (Resolve-Path "build\wp1-native-toolchain").Path
$env:UV_PYTHON            = "$toolchain\python\python.exe"
$env:UV_PYTHON_DOWNLOADS  = "never"
$env:UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT = "C:\ccbuildvenv"
& "$toolchain\uv\uv.exe" sync --frozen --all-groups `
    --python "$toolchain\python\python.exe" --project .

# MSVC FIRST: importing vcvars re-exports the whole cmd environment, PATH
# included, so a PATH prefix set before this is silently wiped.
cmd /c '"C:\ccmsvc\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat" >nul 2>&1 && set' |
  ForEach-Object { if ($_ -match "^([^=]+)=(.*)$") {
      Set-Item ("Env:" + $matches[1]) $matches[2] -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue } }

# Toolchain prefix SECOND.
$env:PATH = "C:\ccbuildvenv\Scripts;$toolchain\node;$toolchain\uv;$env:PATH"

& "C:\ccbuildvenv\Scripts\python.exe" scripts\build_native_installer.py
```

The build venv is seeded *from* the reviewed interpreter, so
`sys._base_executable` resolves to the reviewed build while the venv still
carries the project's dependencies. Neither a bare PATH-prepend of the
provisioned python nor an unreviewed system python satisfies both at once.

Why the ordering rule is spelled out: prepending the toolchain before
importing vcvars leaves the ambient `uv` on PATH, and the build then dies four
stages later with `uv executable SHA-256 68a22cba... != pinned d4ffe0b7...`,
which does not obviously mean "your PATH got clobbered".

### Useful flags

* `--stage-only` — stop after staging and verifying both payloads; skip Tauri.
* `--skip-closure-build` — reuse an existing tree at `--tree-out`.
* `--skip-app-build` — reuse an existing payload at `--app-tree-out`.

## Where it stops

Measured on a clean Windows 11 workstation, 2026-08-20, with everything above
verified as matching the reviewed identities:

| Stage | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Runtime closure | **PASS** — 106 PE files, 221 files, 75,319,816 bytes; `manifest_verification: PASS` byte-for-byte |
| Toolchain provisioning | **PASS** — every hash matched, MSVC `19.50.35730` |
| PyAV compile | **PASS** — compiled, linked, and repaired into a wheel |
| PyAV reproducibility pin | **FAIL** — `av-18.0.0-cp311-abi3-win_amd64.whl byte length 4346817 != pinned 4346940` |

`build_native_pyav_wheel.py` requires the wheel it just compiled to be
**byte-identical** to a pinned SHA-256. This machine's is 123 bytes different.

### Where the difference actually is

A copy of the reviewed wheel exists on this workstation
(`sandbox-lab/hoststore/install/runtime/WHEELS/`), so the two were unpacked and
compared file by file rather than guessed about.

**All seven FFmpeg DLLs differ in content while being byte-for-byte identical
in size:**

| DLL | bytes | pinned sha256 (16) | this build (16) |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| avcodec-62 | 3,514,880 | `1b8a35bf0bd28b3f` | `a8553288873154e4` |
| avdevice-62 | 107,008 | `5f0e7e212e01d810` | `7be1228dd23aafe6` |
| avfilter-11 | 254,976 | `18b4c7562251d5b3` | `03688250e4d600f0` |
| avformat-62 | 708,096 | `d3549e7b0207d77e` | `62f70c7e6a2ba107` |
| avutil-60 | 1,126,912 | `d78abe5993aa05b7` | `5c762295f9eaa780` |
| swresample-6 | 231,936 | `64fdc591075021be` | `986cd78fbbdd46b6` |
| swscale-9 | 1,175,040 | `6d2f4546dfa64584` | `0bee8162081880b5` |

Everything else follows from that. `delvewheel` mangles each DLL's filename
with a hash of its content, so all seven names change; every `.pyd` embeds
those names in its import table, so all 44 extension modules change while
keeping their exact sizes; `RECORD` changes because the names did. The 123-byte
total delta is the zip and RECORD bookkeeping around a much larger content
difference.

Comparing `avutil` byte-wise: 170,697 differing bytes in 7,055 runs, mostly
one- and two-byte deltas in address operands, many of them a constant `0x70`
apart. That is shifted code layout, not metadata.

Both DLLs carry a `IMAGE_DEBUG_TYPE_REPRO` (type 13) debug entry, so both were
reproducibly linked and their `TimeDateStamp` is a content hash rather than a
clock reading — `0x38e86ec9` against `0x9e72ac9b`. The difference is real
compiled output.

### What is and is not pinned

Pinned, verified, and matching on this machine:

* compiler `19.50.35730`, linker `14.50.35730.0`
* MSYS2 base, and `diffutils`, `make` and `nasm` — every FFmpeg build tool,
  by SHA-256
* the FFmpeg source archive and the PyAV source, by SHA-256
* `delvewheel==1.13.0`
* `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`, `PYTHONHASHSEED=0`
* the repacked provenance notice, which is entirely constants

Not pinned:

* **the Windows SDK's servicing level.** `Windows11SDK.26100` names a component
  and `10.0.26100.0` is a directory name; nothing checks which servicing build
  of the ucrt/um headers and libraries is inside it. This is the best-supported
  remaining hypothesis for the divergence, and it is a hypothesis, not a
  finding.

One caveat about `/Brepro`: `reproducible_build_environment` sets `CL` and
`LINK` to `/Brepro`, but `build_minimal_ffmpeg` deliberately pops both before
configuring FFmpeg (stray flags in `CL` break configure's compile probes). The
REPRO debug entry above shows FFmpeg's own build still links reproducibly, so
this is not the cause — but it does mean the wrapper's determinism settings do
not reach the FFmpeg build the way they reach PyAV's.

### What this means

The reviewed wheel hash **is not reproducible from the reviewed toolchain
specification**. Every input that specification names was verified identical
here, and the output still differs.

Corroboration that this machine is not simply unstable: an earlier, unrelated
build on this same workstation
(`civiccast-tester-dispatch/tester-handoff/native-caption-r7/controller/artifacts/`)
produced a wheel **byte-identical** to this one — 4,346,817 bytes, SHA-256
`2eb68720311d463c…`. Two independent builds here agree with each other and
disagree with the pin, so the divergence is between machines, not between runs.

Until the missing input is identified and pinned, this build cannot be
completed by following its own recipe on a clean machine, and the same pin will
fail in CI whenever the `windows-latest` image drifts. That has not been
observed in CI only because the native candidate workflow has never completed a
run in this repository.

## Signing

`build_native_installer.py` produces an **unsigned** `.exe`. Signing happens in
`native-beta-candidate-artifacts.yml` via Azure Artifact Signing and needs
repository credentials that are not set here:

| Kind | Name |
| --- | --- |
| Variable | `CIVICCAST_PACK_PUBLIC_KEY_BASE64` |
| Variable | `CIVICCAST_PACK_SIGNING_KEY_ID` |
| Secret | `CIVICCAST_PACK_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` |
| Secret | `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` |
| Secret | `AZURE_TENANT_ID` |
| Secret | `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET` |

The pack build fails closed without them:
`throw "Pack signing private-key secret is missing."`

## Cleaning up

```powershell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force C:\ccmsvc, C:\ccbuildvenv, build\wp1-native-toolchain,
  build\native-runtime-tree, build\native-app-tree, build\native-pyav-cache,
  build\native-app-cache, "$env:TEMP\civiccast-toolchain-cache"
```

Nothing above is placed on the system PATH or registered with Windows.
