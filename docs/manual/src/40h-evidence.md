# Appendix H: Measured evidence and known limits {#app-evidence}

This appendix preserves historical evidence and its build identity. Use the verification record matching the package for its identity and checks. The [Beta 18 record](https://github.com/scottconverse/civiccast-native/blob/main/docs/releases/v1.0.0-beta.18-verification.md) remains historical; the published Beta 20 package checks are in the [Beta 20 verification record](https://github.com/scottconverse/civiccast-native/blob/main/docs/releases/v1.0.0-beta.20-verification.md). The older beta.10 record is `docs/releases/v1.0.0-beta.10-verification.md`, with evidence under `ops/beta10-oversight/` in the repository.

## Historical Beta 11: three channels, 72 hours, 99.78% live caption-input coverage

Public, Government and Education ran together for 72 hours without a service restart. All 216 scheduled checkpoints reported healthy service status. Recorded live caption-input coverage was **99.78%**, calculated from 1,695 seconds of logged discarded input across 777,600 channel-seconds. This is a historical Beta 11 measurement, not a Beta 16 measurement. The [Beta 11 72-hour host report](https://github.com/scottconverse/civiccast-native/blob/main/docs/ops/beta11-host-caption-performance-72-hour-2026-10-11.md) preserves channel totals and the run identity. Earlier Beta 11 48-hour evidence remains linked in that report.

## H.1 Which build each result comes from

| Evidence | Build | What it covers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Clean-install Gate A lane, 10 of 10 criteria | The **published** beta.10 installer and packs (commit `b6520847`) | Install, first start, console and portal render, clerk workflow, captions, playout, 5-minute soak, install progress, completion |
| Eight-hour watched run, 3 channels | Earlier internal build `C16`; the four key engine files are identical to the published source | Playout, program changes, loudness, preparation times |
| About 59 hours of uptime, 2 channels | Earlier internal build `C15`, **not** the published build | Long-run stability of the engine |

No long run was done on the published beta.10 installer. That build contains later fixes (including the watchdog that ends a stuck program change) and installer fixes relative to the earlier internal builds.

## H.2 Eight-hour watched run (2026-10-01 16:30 to 2026-10-02 00:30, Mountain time)

One lab station, three channels (education, government, public) airing real programs at the same time, captions embedded in the output.

| Measure | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Station service | One process for the whole 8 hours; no restart, no crash |
| Slate or filler after startup | None |
| Station errors and watchdog firings | 0 and 0 |
| Verification checks | 41 run, 40 passed, 1 raw failure (explained below) |
| Loudness | 16 of 16 four-minute windows passed on all three channels (target -16 LUFS, plus or minus 1) |
| Program changes | 50 watched, no holes, no errors; picture gap at most 0.033 s, sound gap at most 0.041 s |
| Preparation of upcoming programs | 51 logged; the longest took 389 s, inside the lead time of about 11 minutes |
| Disk | 46 GB of the 60 GB conform-cache budget used; 810 GB free |

The one raw failure was a check that the education playlist advanced between two samples. It was judged a sampling blip by the run's own records, but a hiccup of under five seconds cannot be ruled out by direct observation, and the raw failure stands in the record.

## H.3 About 59 hours of two channels on the air (the "accidental soak")

After a planned run ended on 2026-09-29, the lab station was left running. The station service started on 2026-09-29 at 02:59 and was still running, with no restart, when it was checked on 2026-10-01 at 14:10, which is about 59 hours. Roughly 51 of those hours were after the planned run ended and were not being watched.

- **Government and public channels:** 27 of 28 programs and 111 of 112 seamless program changes went through. Both channels stayed on the air to the end of the period, with no slate, no filler and no crash.
- **Education channel:** it got stuck in a program change on 2026-09-30 at about 03:44 and then showed black picture and silence for about 34 hours until the service was restarted. The watchdog that now ends that kind of stuck program change was built afterwards and is in the published Beta 10 build. The exact stall has not recurred since.
- **One caption file error:** the government channel logged one isolated "permission denied" error while renaming a caption file.

**How to state this fairly.** The same playout engine has run two channels on one lab station for more than two days. That is not the same as saying beta.10 has done so, because the long run used an earlier build. It is two channels on one station, not two stations, and it was assessed from service logs, program-change records and sampled output, not by inspecting every second of video.

## H.4 Limits recorded for beta.10

1. **Two program-change first attempts aborted and recovered** on the government channel during the eight-hour run, each in about 3 seconds with no visible effect on air.
2. **One single-frame video drop** (0.033 s) at a join inside a program.
3. **Quiet source material is reported, not leveled** when it is too quiet for the loudness control's maximum lift.
4. **Eleven playout-engine unit tests fail** in the same way on the published tree and the installed tree; they were failing before this build and are unexplained.
5. **An unexplained rebuild of a long cached program** was seen in the previous internal run and is unresolved.
6. **Upgrades were not proven for beta.10.** Installing beta.10 over an earlier release was not tested; use the matching release record for the package you plan to install.
7. **A first install with neither the full kit (installer plus its `packs` and `station` folders) nor an earlier install was not proven for beta.10.** The code requires the kit. See [Chapter 10](#ch-installing) for the current package contents and evidence link.
8. **Several staff-console screens described behavior the beta.10 code did not have.** Current screen notes in Part I use the current scope where the mismatch remains.

## H.5 What is not proven

- The beta.10 record contains no human field sign-off or run at a real station; this is not a statement about later field observations or packages.
- No 24-hour or 72-hour soak was run on the beta.10 published build. A separate dev7 overlay soak and Beta 11 package results are documented separately, not as beta.10 evidence.
- The beta.10 record does not establish physical broadcast video-card checks, real cable-headend acceptance or sustained production use at a real PEG station.

## H.6 How to use this evidence

Read sections H.1 through H.5 as historical evidence for their named builds and runs. For the published Beta 20 package, use the current operating chapters and its verification record; keep each measured result associated with its recorded source and run.
