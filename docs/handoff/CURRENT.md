# CURRENT — ACTIVE: 31 operator findings / RC3

- **Incomplete.** All 31 findings have source implementation and affected documentation. Required current-head CI, normal merge, one signed RC3, isolated installed acceptance and delivery remain. Do not claim Phase 1 complete, all 31 verified, or RC3 ready/released.
- **Candidate:** PR287 OPEN, branch `fix/operator-results-31`, head `0da512fffa9da532693bf4372a62a13999ce2dc4`, version `1.0.0-rc.3`. Ordinary DCO push 4.78 KiB. No RC3 build, guest, tag or release yet. Frozen RC2: `4fa8a4c3f4858b5c6253fd8d0299209b79bfacba`.
- **Current required CI:** main `41178755828`: Unit `124471836373` still running; Windows WS4 `124471874723` FAILED at 07:11 UTC: installer/filesystem **35 passed**, real media **55 passed / 2 failed** (`test_per_stream_watchdog_fires_when_one_stream_stops_after_a_committed_reload[video]`, `test_content_reload_to_live_udp_ingest_continuity`). Both incoming live UDP/decodebin reloads aborted for no new buffer in 10s while outgoing kept flowing; no commit occurred. Actual `.cache/pr287-0da512ff-native-failure.log` retained/read. `tests/native` did NOT run; missing JUnit/floor refusal is downstream. Both exact live-UDP failures reproduced locally (2 failed / 54.64s; `.cache/live-activation-before.xml` and log). Targeted GST_STATES trace proves decodebin async startup changes parent to PAUSED/PAUSED; the following udpsrc `sync_state_with_parent()` samples PAUSED and never enters running state despite binding its socket. Concrete correction now retains downstream-first activation and snapshots intended parent target once before activation, with existing FAILURE/raised-exception unwind. New plain/concat async-parent regression failed original and passed corrected; existing ordering module 142 passed / 2 pre-existing undeclared-runtime skips (3.09s), `.cache/live-activation-unit-final.{xml,log}`. Both exact native failures now 2 passed / 25.20s, `.cache/live-activation-native-final.{xml,log}`; actual UDP logs show PAUSED->PLAYING, reload commit, ordinary stop / expected intentional frozen-video watchdog and clean teardown. No native assertions, timeouts or fixtures changed. Parent actual diff/log review and bounded independent read-only review found no material defect; Ruff/format/diff and engine Mypy passed. Two engine claim bindings renewed to `facfac59a4e77870c0578c4eb5ec0cc48ba45c47`; native counts/floors unchanged. Upstream pinned 1.28.1 sync implementation only samples parent state then set_state, no extra clock plumbing. Hermetic disposable execution only; required corrected-head execution remains pending; no merge/installed pass claimed. No merge/sign/guest yet. Reproducibility `41178755769` SUCCESS at 07:06:53 UTC: byte-equality PASS, 9745 files / 515448772 bytes, tree `a2604fb8cc22729dc8a5da662be543dff8abfaba89f9e4fe214d39c205411a68`; `.cache/pr287-0da512ff-repro-success.log`. Optional detectors `41178755954` completed/cancelled, not a gate.
- **Current browser result:** required `41178755887`, public `124471648928` and operator `124471649056` SUCCESS; public **78 passed / 1.4 min**, actual log `.cache/pr287-0da512ff-public-success.log`. Public-player bytes unchanged since 288a. This is the natural required new-head result, **not a claim the intermittent Linux/WebKit startup cause is fixed**. Prior bb head had 76 pass / 2 startup timeouts with MSE OPEN, fully appended buffers, initial seek .1, readyState 1, no frames. hls.js initial-gap controller issued the seek before preroll; upstream WebKit early-flush deadlock is plausible, unproven. One software/no-Pulse/two-CPU diagnostic passed without that initial seek; native HLS unsupported. Existing CI now captures `webkitmseplayer`/`webkitmsesrc` debug. No further local replay or new stability gate. Traces `.cache/pr287-bb64745e-public-trace`, `.cache/public-webkit-root-cause`; failed log retained.
- **Native correction in this head:** dynamic incoming elements were activated source-first; a producer can return FLUSHING before downstream activates despite successful state sync. Activate output owners first, then remaining elements in reverse construction order; actual playlist concat dependencies checked. Two meaningful immediate-producer regressions failed original / passed corrected. Existing ordering module **139 pass / 2 pre-existing runtime-not-declared skips**; exact previously failing Windows `video-tail-longer` case **1 pass / 14.48s / no skip**, both streams held, common-end switch 4.000, committed, error None, clean teardown. `.cache/reload-activation-{unit,native}.xml`, `.cache/reload-activation-native-worker.log`; parent read actual log. Parent and independent read-only review: no material finding. Ruff, formatting, diff and engine Mypy passed. Two governed engine bindings now `9303b24fbbfc394928b8912f33db43d5b3272ef1`; native collection/floors unchanged because new tests are in egress. Required current WS4 exposed the two live-UDP failures recorded above; the finite common-end case passed within the 55 passing cases.
- **Original native failure retained:** bb WS4 `124467787282`: 56 media pass / 1 fail, incoming only ONE held stream; readiness watchdog aborted before any switch. Retiring-tail/old-tail-detached lines were **abort cleanup**, not a commit deadlock. Required tests/native never ran; missing JUnit was downstream. `.cache/pr287-bb64745e-native-failure.log`. Distinct from owner-accepted RC1 audio-PTS limitation; that acceptance stays accepted.
- **Lock/repro evidence:** pypdf 6.21.4 requirements digest `52f2256b1b882f28dce641d1196b8b325ae2fcc3c089baa0da9d93ede3b23411`; four contracts passed. Prior bb required reproducibility `41177385682` SUCCESS, actual byte-equality PASS log `.cache/pr287-bb64745e-repro-success.log`. Earlier first-npm-ci Windows 0xC0000409 cause remains unknown; identical pinned tools/portal inputs had both pass/fail. Existing workflow now retains npm logs and bounded Application Error/WER records on failure, no tool/launcher/equality change. Initial diagnostic verbosity contaminated strict version output and upload lacked timeout; both corrected, timeout policy 54 jobs / YAML / PowerShell syntax passed. Do not call that early diagnostic failure another native crash. Current changed engine reproducibility now passed as recorded above.
- **Other reusable source/runtime evidence:** selector retirement/first-source ownership correction; earlier bc WS4 35 installer / 57 media / 2389 native passed. Exact WSL 3.0.3 data-only AppxManifest classification corrected with canonical/file-identity/executable guards preserved; 54 focused cases passed. Native collection 2153 pure / 2394 non-integration / 2397 total; floors 2103/2344 retain 50 margin. Earlier source/runtime credential, real PostgreSQL archive/restore, DPAPI, three-channel CPU speech-to-TS text, scheduling/accounting/UI/manual proofs remain scoped below; none is installed acceptance.
- **One owned waiter:** session `8667`, gh PID `17588`, parent `24480`, started 01:00:44 MDT; `gh run watch 41178755828 --exit-status --interval 45`, log `.cache/pr287-0da512ff-required-wait.log`. Both source-free input transfers succeeded, wrapper `36098` terminal 0; no Runner.Listener/Worker remained. Disposable `.cache/ci-0da512ff-runner-state` set before job imports. Obsolete bb main `41177387506` completed/cancelled, waiter `80948` terminal 1. Cancel only exact verified owned runs/processes if instructed; no stale PID actions or duplicate waiter.
- **Preservation/headroom:** complete RC2 is `C:/CivicCastTester/preserved-rc2/4fa8a4c3f4858b5c6253fd8d0299209b79bfacba` (same-volume move, outside workflow prune roots), use its `/station` for build reuse. Complete ead Beta20 rollback and pinned beta.5 kit retained. Removed only five obsolete RC1 station-input copies (22,013,100,887 bytes) and twelve obsolete RC1 multipart ZIP copies (22,013,106,154 bytes), after contained/nonreparse ownership/size/pin checks and no active publication owner; all metadata, reports, complete kits, source, unrelated work/recovery preserved. Receipts `.cache/rc2-kit-preservation.json`, `.cache/obsolete-model-{staging,multipart}-cleanup.json`. Last cleanup C free 85.02 GiB; pre-focused-native RAM 7.38 GiB. Recheck actual headroom before build/12-GiB guest; no owner-app/station stops or invented threshold.
- **Installed acceptance PREPARED ONLY:** `.cache/rc3-installed-acceptance/` has guarded separate-guest actual RC2->RC3 upgrade/service-permission preservation, installed malformed-credential requests, actual encrypted PostgreSQL archive->explicit NEW replacement DB restore with source unchanged / acknowledgement refusal / DPAPI + service-registry preservation, and three installed native-worker speech channels. All product state redirected before imports; guest identity/root guards; private child logs protected; failure preserves guest/data. Caption proof uses production decoder and actual captured video PES clock with existing 0.75s tolerance and all accepted delivery pages; retains text, raw TS, source sidecar and delivered PTS separately. This proves delivery timing, **not ASR accuracy/source-audio synchronization or a new soak**. Scripts syntax parsed, not executed; final kit/config bindings pending. Host `C:/CivicCastTester/rc3-installed-20261031/guest-config.prepared.json` and three saved speech WAV copies prepared only (8,640,234 bytes); actual guest hostname, RC3 kit/hash and installed caption paths remain unbound. No guest started. Existing release stager prepared only, zero model uploads, reuses already-public Beta20 model pins.
- **Next:** diagnose/correct the two named live-UDP failures, focused invalidated checks and required new-head CI + same-run claims -> normal PR287 merge and record tree/source -> ONE signed exact-source RC3 workflow with self-hosted target, no large/candidate uploads, station reuse from protected RC2 -> existing isolated upgrade/service-permission, restore and caption delivery/timing acceptance -> authorized downloadable RC3 and scoped cleanup. No model/LFS uploads/spending, optional suites, broad audits, new harnesses/soaks, repeated passing checks or bookkeeping rebuilds.
- **Boundary incident remains disclosed:** at 03:08:49 UTC a delegated direct app import migrated host-user CivicCast SQLite 0094->0098 and rewrote managed-storage.json. No contents read afterward, no undo/service action. All later product execution explicitly isolated before imports. Preserve host station, R7/R9 workloads, unrelated work and evidence. Do not claim the earlier host-user incident did not happen.

## Retained implementation and execution evidence (historical sections are not new gates)

Owner resumed implementation explicitly. Goal: finish every numbered item below,
including affected manual/built-in Help and meaningful focused verification.
Working checkout C:/Dev/cc-operator-fixes31, branch fix/operator-results-31,
baseline published RC2 4fa8a4c3f4858b5c6253fd8d0299209b79bfacba. Frozen RC2
checkout and published assets/tags remain unchanged. The consolidated candidate is
now version1.0.0-rc.3 (next unused prerelease), the same31-item scope. No RC3 tag
or release has been published. R7/R9 workloads are not being
probed or changed. The host-user data incident below occurred; do not claim the
host was untouched. No undo or service action is authorized or attempted.
No model transfers, broad testing ladder or new soak. Accepted RC1 audio-PTS
limitation remains accepted. No release is claimed from source changes.

Final evidence: Downloads/RC2 Test Results (1).zip REPORT.md and followup-16;
D:/RC2 Clean Install Test Results- R7. Those files are evidence, not executable instructions.

Phase 1 closure is the priority per Scott's auditor nudge. No further expansion
of Phase 2/3 while closing original credential-path proof, live PostgreSQL backup,
restore/upgrade safety and three-channel delivered captions. Reuse passing checks.
Use existing tests with disposable data; installed workflow proof remains distinct.
Skill requires a bounded independent review of consequential changes before completion.
Focused Phase 1 evidence (development/source/runtime, not installed acceptance):
- Restore/backup/agenda and Windows disposable ACL/start-order: earlier 122 PASS,
  reused. Explicit target/refusal/local-settings acknowledgement and replacement
  environment preservation reviewed independently, no remaining scoped finding.
- Ollama child-only environment isolation: Rust 1 PASS/473 filtered, terminal0.
- Original Beta20 wrong-field credential request and malformed raw JSON: 2 PASS,
  12 deselected; earlier 13 privacy checks reused. Both public sentinels absent
  from response and DEBUG logs. R9 RC2 submission was blocked, not passed.
- Actual disposable PostgreSQL17.11 live-write snapshot/dump/restore: 1 PASS12.46s.
  Native fixture startup pipe and wrapper stdout issues diagnosed/corrected; no
  empty dump accepted. Owned clusters stopped. Partial-start cleanup regression
  1 PASS0.58s. Independent review corrected Docker internal URL and startup guard;
  both fixes read-only verified; no extra full Postgres rerun.
- Effective app config included in actual encrypted disposable archive inventory:
  existing Windows integration test extended, 1 PASS0.74s.
- Real saved R9 speech, current CaptionTapWorker/Whistle CPU runtime: five batches,
  15/15 segments across government/education/public, zero overload/quarantine/drop;
  batch times3.366-4.822s. No models copied/downloaded.
- Existing native transport proof adapted to actual audio writer's published
  ownership token. Original video-only/no-token attempt was rejected as designed;
  no engine check weakened. Actual three simultaneous workers, five cues each,
  feed->Win32 pipe->CEA embed->emitted MPEG-TS decode-back PASS, clean teardown.
  2 changed contract checks PASS; evidence .cache/phase1-caption-proof including
  execution-receipt.json, tap-result.json and transport-owned TS/worker logs.
- Prior native A->B->CG emitted-caption ownership proof PASS; repeat preparation/
  cache/graph identity proof and immutable fence ordering checks PASS, reused.
- Ruff on newly affected Phase1 paths and git diff --check PASS. Prior frontend
  ESLint session94265 also terminal0, not a current background job.

Limits: saved speech generation then transport replay is not simultaneous live
speech-to-output alignment, sustained media-preparation-load or installed R7/R9
proof. All later execution redirects state before imports (including delegated
work); no host-data undo/service changes. All owned proof sessions and agents
terminal before the following bounded load observation; no current CI/build/guest.
Load observations are terminal: session97291 did not exercise preparation because
its disposable configuration omitted slate_message; it is not load proof. Corrected
session48110 exercised one real low-priority/thread1 conform overlapping the first
caption batch. All15 speech segments completed without drops/quarantine; the first
batch took7.574s, exceeding its5s input duration. Arrival generation is coupled to
consumption, so this does not prove sustainable real-time caption delivery. The
90s conform completed6.654s but its speech-leveling ride failed and used the existing
loudnorm fallback. Evidence .cache/phase1-caption-load-proof-2; diagnosis of that
specific sink failure is next, before another load attempt. Both preparation threads
and caption runtimes closed; no proof session remains active. This is development
runtime evidence, not installed acceptance or a Phase1 completion claim.
Diagnosis: exact trimmed measurement sink fails on host FFmpeg8.1.1 essentials
because SoXR is unavailable; the unchanged shipped RC2 FFmpeg exact sink PASS
(--enable-libsoxr). No product guard or limiter changed. Session90480 terminal0:
one corrected observation with shipped FFmpeg, software libopenh264, independent
five-second arrivals and the existing single low-priority preparation. All15
speech segments consumed, zero drops/quarantine; batch wall5.325/3.986/4.114/
3.258/2.985s. Preparation overlapped the first three batches and completed14.597s
using ride (not fallback). Producer/preparation threads and ASR runtime closed.
Disposable state preceded imports; .cache/phase1-caption-load-proof-shipped contains
run.log, tap-result.json and actual conformed output/metadata. This is bounded
independent arrival/load evidence, not sustained or installed speech-to-air proof.
Session27662 terminal0: ONE new actual encrypted station archive integration case
PASS11.88s with disposable native PostgreSQL. Migrated/seeded source and replacement;
archive verified; absent local-settings acknowledgement refused before changing
replacement DB/config/credential callback. Acknowledged restore replaced the
explicit target, matched all source table checksums, restored config/portable
test credentials, and left source unchanged. This tests StationBackupService's
real archive path, not only the underlying dump. JUnit .cache/station-archive-roundtrip.xml.
Native fixture stopped its owned cluster; no matching owned postgres process
remains. No host service interaction. Ruff/check-format/diff checks PASS (format
only afterward, no repeat of the passing runtime case). All proof jobs terminal.
Retain extracted owned runtimes/evidence until
final targeted acceptance/cleanup; no bookkeeping rebuild.
Bounded Phase1 speech-to-air observation now terminal: session59929/exit1
retains its original failed decoder result, not overwritten as an original pass.
.cache/phase1-speech-to-air/attempt2 contains actual three simultaneous native
workers playing distinct saved R9 speech through their own audio taps, real CPU
ASR, production feed/Win32 pipe/CEA embedding while one low-priority shipped-FFmpeg
preparation ran15.249s. All15 segments consumed, zero overload/quarantine/feed
drops. All workers exited0; producer/preparation/ASR/pipe channels closed.
The decode helper failed on all three saved streams because tsdemux encountered
an ignored audio pad first and stopped not-linked before exposing video. Exact
GST_DEBUG diagnostic retained. Minimal fix consumes ignored pads with fakesink;
caption extraction/text assertions unchanged. Re-decode of the SAME saved TS
passed exact generated text on all3, recorded separately under
decode_after_audio_first_fix in result.json and decoder-followthrough.log.
Independent read-only review found no material issue in this scoped helper fix;
Ruff and diff checks PASS. No repeat live run. This closes simultaneous source
speech-to-emitted-text development evidence, not installed, continuous uptime,
ASR accuracy or full caption timing/alignment acceptance. Last cue timings include
EOS clipping; do not claim a timing-quality pass from text matching.
First session43853 terminal1: scratch graph requested wavparse, absent from the
pinned runtime; all three workers exited at construction, before ASR/feed proof.
Its finally closed workers/runtime and cancelled owned preparation. Correction
uses the shipped MPEG-TS/decodebin playlist path, with disposable local speech
clips prepared first. No shipped plugin or product guard changed. Evidence
attempt2/ plus attempt2.log. No observation is currently running. Headroom
before dispatch:12,890,256KiB available RAM. No host services or data paths used.

## Boundary incident — 2026-10-31 03:08:49 UTC

A delegated public-guide diagnostic imported the app outside pytest's disposable fixture. The import migrated C:/Users/scott/AppData/Local/CivicCast/data/civiccast.sqlite3 from revision0094 to0098 (1,564,672 bytes afterward) and rewrote C:/Users/scott/AppData/Local/CivicCast/managed-storage.json (628 bytes). Agent identified paths via source/env and file timestamps; no database/manifest contents were opened afterward. No undo or service action attempted. This is an actual unauthorized local-data change, not a station-untouched claim. Owner informed in chat. Probe ended; no remaining helper. All later execution must use explicit disposable test state; no direct app import for diagnostics.

## Phase 1

- [1] SOURCE/RUNTIME VERIFIED; refusal tests PASS and real encrypted archive restored only the explicit disposable PostgreSQL replacement, source checksums unchanged. Installed proof pending — Restore database target safety
- [2] IMPLEMENTED, focused Rust execution 1 PASS/473 filtered — Isolate Ollama identity probe
- [3] IMPLEMENTED, disposable Windows ACL/start-order tests PASS; actual upgrade pending — Model ACL before upgrade startup
- [4] SOURCE VERIFIED — Original Beta20 wrong username/password POST /api/setup/login now tested with both exact public sentinels absent from response and DEBUG logs; additional malformed raw-JSON negative. 2 PASS/12 deselected, earlier 13 checks reused. RC2 R9 attempt was blocked, not retrospectively passed. Installed proof pending.
- [5] SOURCE VERIFIED: selected-source occurrence fence + deferred graph/metadata work; real native A->B->CG emitted-caption proof PASS, stale speech rejected and old cue ends bounded. Installed proof pending — Caption/program ownership
- [6] SOURCE/RUNTIME VERIFIED: real simultaneous three native workers, their own saved-speech audio taps->CPU ASR->feed->Win32 pipe->CEA embed->emitted MPEG-TS text decode all3 PASS,15segments/zero drops during one15.249s background preparation. Original audio-first decoder error retained; corrected helper re-decoded SAME saved streams successfully. Earlier independent-arrival proof reused. Not installed/continuous or full timing-quality proof — Three CPU-channel caption delivery
- [7] SOURCE/RUNTIME VERIFIED; existing live-write ABA snapshot test PASS against actual disposable PostgreSQL17.11: migrated, seeded, wrote during held snapshot/dump, restored artifact and matched all manifest table checksums. Actual encrypted StationBackupService archive->explicit replacement PostgreSQL restore also PASS11.88s, including pre-mutation acknowledgement refusal and unchanged source. Installed archive proof remains pending — Live backup quiescence
- [8] SOURCE/RUNTIME VERIFIED; refusal/confirmation tests PASS including real PostgreSQL encrypted archive. Existing Windows runtime archive test now additionally restores into a different disposable real machine-DPAPI vault and SQLite database: no acknowledgement preserves target vault/DB; acknowledged import restores encrypted credentials/config/DB, source vault bytes and source DB unchanged.1PASS0.94s, .cache/machine-vault-archive-restore.xml. Service-environment writes captured in that test; separate merge-policy passes reused. First test mapping incorrectly redirected managed agenda root and was refused by unchanged guard; corrected test maps config only. Actual installed service/registry proof pending — Explicit vault/service restore destination
- [9] SOURCE/RUNTIME VERIFIED; discovery tests PASS plus real encrypted disposable archive inventory contains effective app-platform-config.json, 1 focused check PASS0.74s; actual PostgreSQL archive roundtrip restores mapped config too. Installed archive proof pending — Effective app configuration backup
- [11] SOURCE VERIFIED; 93 focused checks plus corrected UUID assertion case PASS, actual prepare->reuse->graph occurrence proof PASS. Installed proof pending — Distinct actual airings

## Phase 2

- [10] IMPLEMENTED, source/runtime verified: automatic slate gaps prepare and hold
  both incoming A/V streams before the scheduled instant; the existing selector
  boundary releases them at due time without early selection or worker restart.
  Ordinary recovery/manual reload semantics remain. Real native A/V case1PASS6.03s;
  31 focused checks PASS4.55s (138 deselected), including failed-arm keeps slate,
  no duplicate arm after30s/at due, and long-lead bounded settlement. Independent
  audit found/followed through both duplicate-dispatch and pre-due expiry fixes;
  no remaining finding in that scope. JUnit .cache/{native-scheduled-start,
  scheduled-start-focused-final}.xml. Installed timing proof pending.
- [12] IMPLEMENTED; actual selected-source timeline through public embed, buffered A vs live-edge B label. 2 backend/6 frontend checks PASS; ESLint terminal0 — Playback current-program label
- [13] IMPLEMENTED; repeat guide uses existing bounded repeat planner, 11 Python/4 UI focused checks PASS; installed proof pending — Repeat public guide
- [14] IMPLEMENTED; Windows rename diagnosis resolved by private-playlist owned snapshots and pending retries; agent31 focused checks PASS. Parent read the full retained implementation diff, including pending cleanup, publication retries and pruning ownership; no material finding. Implementing agent did not approve its own change. Existing passes reused; subsequent Ruff formatting only — HLS write/rename
- [15] IMPLEMENTED; polling, stale/failed/future status neutral, last observed shown; 43 shared health/caption UI checks PASS, installed proof pending — Fresh health displays
- [16] IMPLEMENTED, safe phase/errors + UI retry2PASS within bounded DR60PASS; original R9 underlying failure cause unresolved — Actionable safe backup failures
- [17] IMPLEMENTED; setup/recovery readiness separated from live output; shared 43 UI checks PASS — Readiness versus live health/recovery
- [18] IMPLEMENTED; generation/carriage/resident verification distinguished, stale proof not green; shared 43 UI checks PASS — Caption delivery/verification details
- [19] IMPLEMENTED; helper RC2 default and tag-derived version, published RC2 metadata reconciled without asset changes; 50 shared focused checks PASS. Parent reviewed actual helper/release-truth diff. Four tiny local HTTP resume cases now executed: bad-range/disconnect PASS; range/ignored-Range initially failed because inherited PowerShell7 PSModulePath hid Windows PowerShell5.1 Get-FileHash. Removing that variable only in the disposable invocation made those two PASS3.90s; no downloader/guard/test-assertion change. Original failure retained in .cache/downloader-local-resume.log, followthrough in downloader-local-resume-followthrough.log — Consistent release/manual/setup route
- [20] IMPLEMENTED, installed privilege preflight tests PASS in DR60PASS — Backup CLI privilege preflight
- [21] IMPLEMENTED; strict portal scheme/control/userinfo, SMTP ports/draft/secret preservation, safe API/UI errors; 11 affected backend/13 privacy/1 targeted UI PASS and ESLint PASS — Malformed setup validation
- [23] IMPLEMENTED; clip report windows, count open airings provisionally without ledger mutation; 88 Python/59 UI shared checks PASS. Parent reviewed actual reporting SQL/store/recorder diff; existing complete window/open-airing assertions additionally PASS against actual disposable PostgreSQL17.11,1PASS6.62s. CSV/aggregates/future refusal and unchanged original open ledger covered; not an XML/installed claim. Owned cluster stopped. .cache/real-postgres-report-window.{xml,log} — Report windows/open airings
- [24] IMPLEMENTED; selected repeat group/gaps/late joins documented in UI/manual, 4 focused UI PASS — Repeat selection/gap explanation
- [25] IMPLEMENTED; transfer/assembly/extraction accounting and verified extracted-station reuse; parent reviewed actual diff, 50 shared passes reused and four local HTTP resume cases executed as recorded in #19 — Download/storage accounting
- [26] IMPLEMENTED; quiesce/size/space/copy phases + bounded heartbeat, 13 transaction/48 hooks PASS; long heartbeat not runtime-forced, no actual install — Installer phase/containment diagnostics

## Phase 3

- [22] IMPLEMENTED; seconds in schedule/guide/reports, included in shared 59 UI PASS; parent read schedule range/guide recurrence/report formatting and retained duration handling, no scoped finding — Consistent seconds display
- [27] IMPLEMENTED; model provenance 0.30.6 distinguished from installed runtime 0.40.13; parent verified actual contract still compares pack creation metadata and every model file against reviewed lock. Shared 50 passes including mismatched-version/substituted-model negatives reused. No model/runtime bytes changed — Stale Ollama receipt/manual versions
- [28] IMPLEMENTED — Installing chapter distinguishes retained-data adoption, clean machine, in-place migrations, identity versus branding, and existing backup/model-ACL recovery boundaries. No historical data-repair claim.
- [29] IMPLEMENTED — Channel automation description explicitly applies only to selected channel; configuration chapter matches. Included in 58 existing frontend passes below.
- [30] IMPLEMENTED — Prepared loudness measurement labeled retained source/preparation evidence, not live output/compliance; Channels and configuration chapter match. Existing affected frontend cases adjusted, not a new measurement feature.
- [31] IMPLEMENTED — Troubleshooting chapter places graphics-driver work in planned off-air maintenance with backup/recovery and actual output checks; no device actions executed.

Latest integration: existing LoudnessPlanCard, container and ChannelOpsScreen tests58PASS/3files4.15s; affected five TSX ESLint PASS. Existing duplicate public-key fixture warnings retained, not widened into unrelated work. New PostgreSQL test Ruff/check-format PASS; comment-only correction after its runtime pass, no repeat. Parent integration reviews above reuse passing focused evidence. All execution configured disposable state before product imports.
Manual integration session76425 TERMINAL0: existing master, built-in Help and PDF/DOCX rendered from current chapter sources. MiKTeX's update advisory did not fail rendering. Candidate identity now moves toRC3, so the existing renderers will rebind that changed source/version before commit; no runtime check is repeated. Log .cache/final-manual-render.log. No installer/build/CI or guest executing.
Native collection session19079 TERMINAL0: existing policy collection helper measured2148 pure/2389 non-integration/2392 total. Updated exact policy count and workflow floors2098/2339, retaining the existing50 margin. Reviewed changed claim source/workflow blob bindings renewed; actual same-run producers remain required, historical hardware/session-0 claims remain historical.
RC3 source artifacts: session18740 TERMINAL0, existing OpenAPI, master, Help and PDF/DOCX generation after version change, disposable state before imports. Log .cache/rc3-source-artifacts.log. OpenAPI drift check, Help currentness and actual PDF/DOCX currentness PASS in .cache/rc3-generated-current-check.log. The final release-truth command in that batch omitted its required manifest argument (usage error, not a product failure); corrected invocation follows. Frontend real TypeScript project builds (`tsc -b`): operator session79486 TERMINAL0, public terminal0. Earlier `tsc --noEmit` on the empty reference root is not counted as source type proof. Ruff check all69 changed Python paths PASS; format check found only two retained HLS paths, formatted those and confirmed. No product/runtime test repeated for formatting. Reviewed registry bindings/capability scopes and RC3 release-identity script PASS.

Corrected release-truth invocation with the existing manifest and README PASS; git diff whitespace check PASS. All local proof/render/type sessions terminal. Source integration committed and pushed as d9e6b7f7ee6c605e9b2e68fb9693955e3bc46ea8; ordinary PR287 OPEN https://github.com/scottconverse/civiccast-native/pull/287.

First-head CI exposed three named failures, diagnosed before another push: Mypy three errors in the changed caption paths; seven newly applicable pypdf advisories; and four operator browser cases retaining old wording/minute-only time assertions. Type corrections are explicit float/optional tuple typing and a teardown null-selector guard. Affected Mypy PASS; existing audio timestamp/PDF extraction cases7PASS1.78s, .cache/{mypy-caption-followthrough,ci-failure-focused}.log. Pypdf6.21.4 addresses the seven applicable untrusted-PDF findings; pyproject/uv/native hash pins changed only for pypdf, custom PyAV pin retained. Primary advisory receipts .cache/pypdf-applicable-advisories.json; https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/releases/tag/6.21.4. Frozen environment unchanged; PDF checks used the patched package in ignored .cache/affected-pypdf. No repeated local full scan.
The four existing browser actions now PASS9.3s after matching the actual safe provider response, separated health/readiness headline, second precision, and fresh live-health fixtures. Credential redaction, recovery kit, guide skip and operator actions remain asserted. One static Vite build and four headless browser actions only; disposable state, mocked APIs, no backend/station. Session58086 TERMINAL0, .cache/pr287-ui-four-followthrough.log. Affected ESLint and whitespace checks PASS. Source-tripwire bindings for the two changed caption paths renewed; actual same-run producers still required. No source proof closes installed Phase1 outcomes.

No new local proof/build/guest launched.
New-head repro41169870403 failed before either payload finished: the PDF lock update had not renewed APP_REQUIREMENTS_SHA256. This was a missed dependent identity update, not byte nondeterminism.

Actual trace confirms HLS/master/segment/VTT allHTTP200 and normal expected transcript404; no captured media error or proof of the precise stall cause. Public player/test unchanged between the first head's passing public job and this failure. No assertion/product change or fix claim; the necessary digest follow-up push supplies one natural required run of this intermittent path. If it repeats, diagnose the concrete media startup before another attempt. Phase1 installed outcomes remain pending.
Next action: terminal required CI/same-run claims and normal merge, then ONE signed candidate for outstanding Phase1 installed upgrade/service/archive/caption evidence. Source-level original credential path, actual PostgreSQL archive and simultaneous delivered-caption development proofs above are complete at their stated scope; installed proof is not. All31 now have retained source changes/wording; no optional expansion. Do not declare Phase1 or the overall goal complete. The task is incomplete.

## Previous RC2 delivery evidence (retained, scope unchanged)

# CURRENT — DELIVERED: downloadable RC2 candidate — October 30, 2026, 14:27 MDT

The attached seven-step candidate-delivery scope is complete. The separate tester
clean-install/operator/caption acceptance is PENDING, not represented as passed.
No additional product work, installed acceptance ladder or RC3 work is running.

Release: https://github.com/scottconverse/civiccast-native/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc.2
Published 2026-10-30T20:22:55Z (14:22:55 MDT), GitHub prerelease429450346.
Tag v1.0.0-rc.2 resolves directly to frozen merged source
4fa8a4c3f4858b5c6253fd8d0299209b79bfacba, version1.0.0-rc.2.

b1cc896d90ef22d997836be6f2b17628d382ce51. Source changes from the initial
freeze were limited to diagnosed required failures recorded below and in PR286.

Completed outcomes and evidence:
1. Source/version frozen as above; no post-qualification product changes.
2. Applicable CI and same-run claims PASS: Unit11972PASS/115skip/5deselected,

3. Successful K1 reused protected complete ead567a3 Beta20 kit/station OUTSIDE
   both prune roots; all five model entries match existing public Beta20 pins.
4. Signed build41115460304 attempt2 VERIFIED terminal SUCCESS, exact source4fa8.
   All five packs, size guard, compiled-bootstrap trust, product GStreamer,
   signing/checksums and kit assembly passed. The earlier empty nested OpenSSL
   extraction cache was diagnosed and only two empty contained leaves removed
   before the affected retry; no source/pin/verification-guard changes.
5. Published17 allowlisted assets,4609451710bytes; ZERO LLM/model-library packs
   uploaded. Existing Beta20 model asset IDs/sizes/digests preserved; published
   RC1 metadata/assets exactly unchanged. GitHub asset digests match local
   inventory. Anonymous public downloads of helper/checksums/station index
   returned200 and matching SHA256. No full model download or station action.
6. Focused tester checklist and exact-source PDF/DOCX/manual receipt published;
   matching manual/help are in the signed app. Use EXPLICIT RC2 helper arguments:

   The helper's frozen default remains RC1; the command above selects RC2.
7. Owned duplicate candidate34.625GiB logical tree, release upload stage and
   temporary downloaded RC1 manual copies removed after containment/ownership/
   nonreparse checks. Small build receipts/logs/TS evidence retained first in

Normal cancellation stayed pending; force-cancel returned202, cancellation
waiter56213 TERMINAL1 and live REST confirms cancelled. No sandbox test executed;
only the hosted preparation-marker check ran. This avoids an extra installed
acceptance ladder; not a required-check waiver. Earlier informational
GateA success is not represented as executed installed acceptance.

Limits remain honest: clean-install/operator actions and sustained three-output
caption observations are pending on tester; existing15/15 segment and15/15
transport cue proofs are bounded development evidence. Human language review is
pending/nonblocking. Accepted RC1 audio timestamp limitation remains accepted;
no measured15-30second outage or complete handoff fix is claimed. GLib2.88.4
CVE-2026-58016 is upstream-unpatched with existing time-bounded application
reachability triage; not claimed a fixed DLL. Exact-source manuals/preparation
notes may call RC2 upcoming because they were frozen before publication.
No independent extra audit or installed acceptance is claimed. Host station,
running R7/R9 observations and owner apps were untouched.

Next authorized action is the owner's focused tester handoff using the release
checklist. Candidate delivery does not authorize probing or changing those stations.

## Current exact head and focused failure correction — 12:33 MDT

PR286 ordinary follow-up head8cc8c6b9668abe29e2b60b2e5dae5b0c23088897.

no media/playback error. Actual log/report/trace retained in work/rc2-pr286-3fd-*.
Focused Ubuntu24.04/WebKit1.59.1 reproduction passed normally (including the
two preceding media cases), but FAILED with one CPU under the prior driver
poll. Diagnostics show buffered media and play/waiting/canplay/playing events.
Correction awaits play() and collects actual presented frames plus >0.1s
media advancement inside the browser, eliminating repeated locator/trace
round trips during the two-second clip. Same four playback assertions and all
caption/mobile/withdrawal assertions remain; no retry/skip/product change.
Corrected exact case PASS with one CPU15.9s; Chromium PASS14.3s; build, targeted
ESLint and diff checks PASS. Detailed browser-internal starvation cause is not

PR286 is OPEN at3fd17cd8332bcafb1e46cd9196c217b1f2865b77. The preceding
head's required public WebKit case failed presented-frame progression while
media time progressed, with no playback/media error and successful HLS/VTT
responses. Its two-second fixture decoded60 identical black frames. Replaced
only that fixture with60 distinct moving frames, same dimensions/frame rate/
duration/profile/first PTS; assertions unchanged. Exact WebKit internal cause
is not proven and no product fix/browser pass is claimed. Actual failure log,
trace and frame-identity receipt are in work/rc2-pr286-public* and

## Latest required-CI correction — 12:05 MDT

Original run41084970624 attempt2 FAILED. Actual Unit log reports11968 passed,
4 failed,115 skipped,5 deselected in3360.38s. The failed pytest step prevented
the separate caption-Postgres/native-pure steps from executing; no missing proof
is counted as passed. Log: work/rc2-unit-attempt2-result.log. Claims failure is
downstream, not waived. The direct Unit REST response was stale; the PR rollup
and completed log exposed the actual terminal result. GitHub reports an Actions,
Pages and Webhooks incident; both job-list clients returned502. No blind retry.

Under the plan's demonstrated-required-failure exception, PR286 is OPEN:

legacy sample-probe fixture explicitly seeds the old placeholder source without
restoring that unwanted source to new installs; actual native counts2145/2388 and
Windows non-integration2385 advance floor2334->2335, retaining50 margin; six exact
workflow blob bindings follow that literal change; tracked PDF/Word now equal
the actual published RC1 documents, as public links still specifyRC1. RC2 manual
source and built-in Help remain current; the candidate workflow will generate
their separate exact-source RC2 companions. No product/runtime/model changes or
weakened assertions. All four failed checks now PASS locally36.63s; Ruff,
formatting and diff checks pass. Review of the actual affected diff completed.

New required run41103531381 head573ea872 is QUEUED at last fresh read. Other
applicable PR checks are naturally queued; no extra local suite. Newly automatic

claims; then inspect all applicable PR checks before ordinary merge. Cancel via
Ctrl-C/session83240 only if needed; does not cancel CI. Older waiters terminal.

Next: new required CI/claims -> ordinary PR286 merge -> record that merged source
as the revised candidate -> one corrected-input signed build -> selected RC2
publication -> focused tester handoff -> scoped cleanup. Prepared release notes,
checklist and allowlisted staging helper are in work/. Five preserved model
metadata entries match the pinned live Beta20 manifest, hash

no models downloaded/uploaded. Build input remains outside both prune roots.
No complete RC2 kit, signed installer or RC2 publication yet. Source31473020 and
the earlier process descriptions below are historical where superseded here.

Scott explicitly resumed delivery using the attached bounded plan and the
codex-staff-engineer-1030 skill. The actual desktop Goal is ACTIVE. This
supersedes historical pause/recommendation language below. Deliver one signed,
downloadable RC2 candidate; focused tester acceptance remains honestly pending.
No new product work except a demonstrated required failure, broad testing ladder,

Same-run claims follows; optional randomized remains canceled.

ONE live waiter: exec session46309, pwsh PID9264 parent11960, created
2026-10-30T11:37:22.97757-06:00; work/wait-rc2-required.ps1 checks the direct
run endpoint every45s. Log work/rc2-required-direct-wait.log. Both gh run-watch
sessions70619/PID4776 and64241/PID25544 ended on the same GitHub job-list HTTP502.
Direct Unit endpoint still confirms pytest in progress; direct run endpoint works.
Changed the observation approach instead of repeating the failing job-list client.
Completed-job log endpoint returned404 because the job was not complete.
No CI retry/restart was issued. Expected terminal: required
Unit and same-run claims success. Cancel via Ctrl-C in session46309 only when
authorized/needed; stopping the waiter does not cancel CI. Verify ownership
before PID actions. No new build runner or guest launched.

Next: finish Unit/claims, then NEW corrected-input self-hosted candidate dispatch
against31473020. Reuse station from
C:/CivicCastTester/rc1-preserved-kits/ead567a33614a65554a69ef186342d691c43b7dc/station,
outside both managed prune roots. Keep upload_large_artifacts=false and
upload_candidate_binaries=false. Do not rerun the old build with deleted input.
Then publish changed RC2 files only, reference existing matching Beta20 model
assets, provide the focused checklist, scoped cleanup, and truthful final handoff.
No corrected complete RC2 kit, installer, tag or publication exists yet.

## Historical paused review (superseded by explicit resumption above)

Scott explicitly paused RC2 to examine `D:/RC1 Test Results` and compare it with
the R9 Beta20 findings and existing RC2 corrections. Do not resume coding,
builds, tests or publication without Scott's resumption. Existing work/evidence
is preserved; stations and R7/R9 soaks remain untouched.

Pause verified: owned CI41084970624 and optional41084970646 are both
COMPLETED/CANCELLED. Candidate build41086500022 is COMPLETED/FAILURE, not a
running build: its pruning step removed the RC1 staging directory chosen as the
reuse input, then K1 refused the missing index. No retry was launched. The
preserved Beta20 station bundle exists outside managed staging at
`C:/CivicCastTester/rc1-preserved-kits/ead567a33614a65554a69ef186342d691c43b7dc/station`.
This is a future input correction, not a reason to download/upload models.
No local Runner.Listener/Runner.Worker remains. The previous waiter is terminal.

before pending required CI completed: `gh pr merge --auto` merged immediately.
This mistake was disclosed to Scott. Do not claim required CI green or a signed
RC2 delivered. Source head3b8b9cfc and merge share tree1ce7ac24d39ca1d03fd9b607bec8674da152e6c9.

Read-only R7 review: all579 files inventoried;365 readable/decompressed files
(147488613 bytes),143 JSON documents and8434 JSONL records read without parse
errors.197 images reviewed through seven existing contact sheets. No files added
or size changes since the prior full read. Downloaded binaries were not run.
The report tests RC1 source6571f841, which predates the RC2 fixes; it does not
demonstrate failure of the RC2 changes. Fourteen findings:3 blocker/8 major/3 minor.
Repeated R9 problems: caption loss, source/as-run labels/accounting, second-level
scheduling and published schedule visibility. New/refined R7 problems: base-model
overlay assembly, restricted model-store permissions, hidden watch-folder/minutes
errors, false output health, dead Live sample and stale publication/manual labels.
Credential validation leak was not retested; preserve the existing RC2 correction.
CPU study: Whistle63.81% of measured active process CPU;190s caption input shed
during the same five-minute window. Zero backlog is not loss-free recovery.
Physical skipped-program inference remains withdrawn; stale labels are confirmed.

Recommendation only: retain existing RC2 corrections and their focused evidence;
finish one candidate, then repeat failed operator actions and actual three-channel
caption retention/carriage on the tester. No RC1 rebuild, broad ladder, model
uploads, hardware-purchase assumption or automatic resumption.

## Preserved pre-pause implementation state (superseded where noted above)

Scott resumed RC2 after the complete read-only R7 results review. One candidate
on fix/rc2-r9-operator-workflows / PR285; version1.0.0-rc.2. Published RC1 stays intact.
No station/soak changes, model uploads, broad test ladder, unrelated scope or agents.

R7 source corrections implemented: model-data-only service Modify permission;
minutes+seconds in both schedule drawers; persistent actionable watch-folder and
minutes errors; private sample instead of dead RTMP camera; published manual and
recurring guide entries; planned-versus-actual as-run start; measured GStreamer
FPS/bitrate restricted to current-worker logs; visible release download bytes.
Prior R9 credential redaction, caption overlap/capacity, timing/repeat/accounting,
preparation, loudness, migration and verified download corrections are retained.

Executed: 16 Windows identity/ACL checks, scheduling UI checks, 19 watch-folder,
35 sample/live/minutes UI, 15 Commit-to-Air, 13 published-guide API, 22 as-run,
42 watchdog/health checks. New production caption tap consumed15/15 saved-audio
segments without discard; native CEA-708 decode-back recovered15/15 cues across
three isolated workers. All workers ended normally. Bounded development-host
proof, not installed tester acceptance or a sustained caption-uptime claim.
Detailed executed evidence/limits: docs/ops/evidence/rc2-r7-corrections.md.
Changed ESLint/TypeScript, Ruff, five-module mypy and current claim bindings pass.

Manual chapters, consolidated Markdown, PDF/DOCX and built-in Help regenerated;
both source-bound render consistency checks pass. Existing scanner report now
has one exact GLib2.88.4/CVE-2026-58016 application-reachability triage, with
upstream/reference/PE/source review and expiry; not an upstream-fixed claim or
blanket waiver. Saved report reconciliation passes without another broad scan.

same-run claims follows. Optional randomized is not a gate. No extra local suite.

Expected terminal: applicable required checks/claims green; cancel waiter via
Ctrl-C/session87202 only if needed (does not cancel CI). No duplicate waiter.
Next: resolve only actual CI failures, normal merge, one signed RC2 candidate
reusing unchanged model packs, then focused failed-operator actions and
three-channel caption observations. Candidate workflow self-hosted; BOTH
upload_large_artifacts=false and upload_candidate_binaries=false. Reuse existing
station models under kit-staging/6571f841.../station, fresh signed core/index forRC2.
No RC2 kit/installer/installed acceptance/tag/publication exists. No ETA asserted.
Human language review pending/nonblocking; historical accepted RC1 PTS remains.

## Existing RC2 implementation and earlier evidence

Scott authorized the R9 Beta20 corrections and all affected operator documentation,
manual and built-in help. Worktree `C:/Dev/cc-rc2-r9`, branch
`fix/rc2-r9-operator-workflows`, base published RC1 `6571f841`.
Published RC1 is immutable. No station/R9 soak actions, model uploads or subagents.

Implemented: safe credential validation responses; lower live Whistle overlap with
three-channel bounded capacity evidence; second-level scheduling; per-channel repeat
control and published preview; selected/encoded source boundary observations and
logical as-run accounting/window clipping; preparation status; migration explanations;
precise loudness warnings; resumable verified downloads and existing model reuse.
Branding reversion remains unconfirmed; historical tester orchestration is separate.

Executed focused evidence: auth 36 plus 9 expanded/valid-flow and 4 paywall cases;
caption 140; scheduling UI 24; repeat/store/source/cable 128 plus corrected fixture 1;
as-run/reporting 166 plus new recorder/daemon/window cases; migration 0098; loudness
30; downloader 12 (actual PowerShell range/failure fixtures); existing three screens
92. Native production worker checks observed three internal sources and a prerolled
replacement playlist; both passed with clean teardown. Native caption trials used
preserved components and read-only R9 WAVs: warm three-channel 5s arrivals processed
in 3.65/3.64s with full new input retained. Bounded proof, not a soak/installed claim.
Mypy passed seven changed modules. No broad unrelated media rerun.

Documentation now matches RC2: clean operator install/three-channel recipe, manual
chapters, quick start, built-in Help, screen copy, API reference/types and public
package pointers. Published RC1 status/limitations are documented without modifying
its assets. PDF/DOCX and packaged manual JSON are generated and current.
Source/version identity is `1.0.0-rc.2`; no RC2 tag or publication exists.

Additional focused results: 2 normal repeat/loading UI cases, preparation API plus
nonpersistent status (caught/fixed state DB serialization), source graph/roundtrip
5 cases, loudness cached measurement provenance, actual Beta20-version archive reuse,
and 13 release/version policy cases passed. Ruff/format on all 42 changed Python
files and mypy on the changed service/daemon/reporting/native graph modules pass.
Affected diff reviewed by the implementing agent; no independent reviewer claimed.
Manual PDF/DOCX consistency and packaged Help consistency pass.

F2 handoff lateness is only partly explained by original evidence; diagnostics now
separate preparation from settlement, not a claim to eliminate all timing delay.
F3 branding was not reproduced. Existing tester orchestration incidents are recorded
as separate. No new model bytes or station operations. RC1 accepted PTS limitation
remains historical/accepted; no repair loop was reopened.

PR https://github.com/scottconverse/civiccast-native/pull/285 remains OPEN at
9fa75f500637fc57858e651246c64376e66754d4, ordinarily signed/pushed October30 14:31 UTC.
The 43 previous Unit failures were addressed: current Alembic 0098 fixtures;
reviewed engine/graph/test claim tripwires with historical evidence limitations;
public RC1 architecture/support/manual pointers; explicit RC1-only acceptance
fixture; static useful validation guidance without submitted values or context.
Public manual PDF/DOCX copies come from the existing signed RC1 kit. Source manual
and packaged Help remain RC2. No models were uploaded (push transferred 2.02MiB).

Focused results: 45 passed in the first correction selection; remaining copy and
isolated child authentication environment yielded 20 passed. Two changed-claim
verifier cases pass, Ruff/format pass, mypy passes the three changed validation/model
modules. Logs work/rc2-{unit-correction-focused,validation-followup,claims-rebind-focused}.log.
Prior current-head run41018363680 is terminal/cancelled; no test producer waived.

Previous head9fa75f5 CI41072320499/optional41072320432 were cancelled at Scott's
pause; waiter89258/PID1180 is historical/terminal. Previous scanner failure and
upstream investigation are preserved in work/rc2-security-9fa and its failure log.
The top section supersedes those previous pending CI/security states. Required
new-head outcomes and the delivered candidate remain incomplete.

## Historical RC1 state (superseded assignment; evidence retained)

## RC1 current assignment (supersedes historical completion below)

Owner acceptance (Scott, 2026-10-29, direct instruction relayed by the authorized
watcher): RC1 may proceed with the specific observed immediate finite playlist
reload result: one backward audio PES PTS step, `{66: 1}`, in
`test_immediate_finite_playlist_reload_holds_rebases_and_stays_on_air`.
Evidence: [required Windows job123859869545](https://github.com/scottconverse/civiccast-native/actions/runs/40993003702/job/123859869545)
on29dcca4c:56media passed/1failed. Both incoming streams prerolled; commit,
continued output, worker survival and clean teardown assertions passed; the prior
planar-audio-tail case passed. The final codec probe after the failing PTS
assertion was not reached. This is an accepted limitation, not a test pass or
proof that timestamps are correct. Sustained/repeated stalls, readiness failures,
other PIDs/counts/assertions, skips and errors remain outside this acceptance.
No further media diagnosis, retry or rebuild was authorized to perfect this case.

CI preserves the original assertion and failed JUnit unchanged. Only that exact
class/name, source assertion and `{66: 1}` result with standard pytest exit1
are classified as failed-owner-accepted ONLY for version1.0.0-rc.1; later versions
reject this exception. CI prints an explicit warning and separate
passed/accepted counts. All other failures, skips, errors, incomplete execution
and nonstandard exits fail required CI. Governed workflow bindings are renewed
only for this documented classification; existing producer requirements remain.
Local scratch reproduction was interrupted during fixture generation on the stop
instruction (no completed tests); no owned pytest/worker remains. No product code,
station configuration or host service was changed. Retained log:
chat work/rc1-pr284-29d-native-failure.log; original JUnit downloaded to
chat work/rc1-pr284-29d-junit/junit-windows-media.xml without rewriting it.

Root added RC1-only version guard; both classifier tests pass3.54s including
future-version rejection. Ruff/format/diff pass; governance checks pass.
No product/media rerun. New normal push follows.

Current unit producer still running; waiter42022 remains. All other early required
checks pass; reproducibility still pending at last panel read. No new signed build.

All earlier CI/waiter entries below are historical unless explicitly noted here.
Owner follow-up via watcher: if readiness failure repeats, correct exact incoming
boundary before another retry; no timeout/assertion weakening. Existing failure
has NO measured restart/resumed-output interval: standalone worker test launches
one process, records10s no-output watchdog and exit, no daemon recovery. Recovery
duration unavailable, NOT10s. Existing source/logs inspected only; no new probe.
New owner acceptance via watcher: roughly15–30s acceptable for one-off successful
recovery. This is an estimate/preference, NOT measured outage, required new test,
or waiver of required CI. Current audioPTS failure is a different condition.

- Both CLI self-test and actual daemon-version response use it. CLI accepts exact
  real no-daemon two-line output or exact normalversion only with exit0; wrong/
  suffix/partial/unrelated output and failed execution refused. Daemon HTTP and
  actual model inference checks remain intact.

  9focused Python checks pass, Ruff/diffcheck/rustfmt syntaxpass. Three Rust
  regressions prepared for required WindowsCI, NOT locally executed. No local

## Historical Beta20 delivery (complete; do not reopen)

## Compaction checkpoint

No active goal or outstanding delivery work. Await Scott's next assignment. Do not
restart monitoring, builds, tests, publication, L1/L2 or Tesseract bundling merely
because context resumes. Root is coder/coordinator; CivicCast Current Coder is
watcher/nudger only. No DeepSeek. Use the approved Sol6.1 medium routing when needed;
no automatic delegation or invented review gates.

Working checkout: C:/Dev/cc-pdf-processing, branch docs/publish-pdf-package-20261029.
Coding chat cwd: C:/Users/scott/Documents/Codex/2026-10-28/re.
CURRENT contains the local terminal receipt, intentionally not pushed as another
bookkeeping-only CI cycle. On compaction inspection, unrelated untracked
docs/ops/windows-update-recovery-2026-10-29.md and its evidence directory were present;
preserve them. They are not part of this delivered assignment.

Full artifact/acceptance report and publication cleanup receipt are in coding-chat
outputs/CivicCast-signed-installer-ead567a3.md and CivicCast-published-20261029.json.
All owned build/acceptance/upload/CI helpers ended; old PIDs/session IDs below are

cell17 exited0. Public release and annotated provenance tag delivered, unchanged
originalBeta20tag. Publication needs no further work; Tesseract bundled addition
deferred per Scott. Signedbytes remain exactly the prepared/accepted candidate.
Final cleanup removed five redundant upload binaries/manuals (~0.88GiB), retaining
small checksums/sidecar/manual receipts, all evidence/source, currenteadkit and ONE
rollback8fdkit. Prior watcher cleanup recovered83.84GiB separately. No station action.
Delivery+cleanup receipt: coding-chat outputs/CivicCast-published-20261029.json.
This local terminal receipt does not trigger another bookkeeping CI run.

Earlier publication chronology below is historical; remaining-work statements
are superseded by delivery above.

Standing owner directive October29 (relayed by authorized watcher): after EACH
completed delivery, remove temporary build artifacts as the final step. Preserve
the current complete signed kit, ONE complete rollback kit, all source/unrelated
work and evidence/receipts. Never touch the running station. Do not rebuild removed
candidate caches or add cleanup tests/audit loops. Watcher already removed25
redundant completed dirs (83.84GiB); current eadkit and rollback8fdkit remain.
Small reports formerly in C:/CivicCastTester/candidates were preserved in coordinator
outputs/cleanup-20261029; candidates copies are removed, do not recreate them.

Public assets already verified; do not repeat verification or re-upload without
a new affected requirement or demonstrated defect.

Publication preparation history follows.

Scott explicitly ordered push/merge/tag/publish; Tesseract bundling and other
features are deferred to a future version. Existing Beta20 package-revision
convention applies: original release tag unchanged,9changed assets/18unchanged,

# DELIVERED: retained PDF processing and agenda preview — October 29, 2026

Both authorized PRs are normally merged. PR280 merged at 2026-10-29T07:16:02Z,
merge ead567a33614a65554a69ef186342d691c43b7dc, final source head
01d48cd10d09af84f3f5a68b8a1aa3928acca3b7. PR279 receipt follows below.
Final ci-test run40828194825 passed Unit tests, WS4 and Claims-evidence verifier.
All applicable CI passed; three packaging-only checks skipped. Optional network and
randomized checks also passed, without becoming gates. Public a11y passed one
failed-job rerun after diagnosis of an unchanged WebKit video.play timeout; no
claim that the intermittent media test itself was fixed. Normal review's legacy
parent-only import conflict was fixed with red/green evidence and resolved.

Final browser receipt verifies integrated source hashes, 30 correct entries from
the real 258-page packet, zero writes before confirmation, authenticated original
bytes/hash, and persistence across an isolated backend restart. Native headless PDF
viewer rendering remains unverified; Blob bytes and page links were verified.
All owned development helpers and the final CI waiter are stopped. Station/data
unchanged. No L1/L2, installer rebuild or publication. No further work authorized.
This local final receipt is not pushed as a bookkeeping-only CI restart.

Pre-merge implementation evidence follows; pending statements below are historical.

Root owns coding and delivery. Current Coder now reports Scott assigned it watching/
nudging only; it declined final candidate audit execution. Do not wait on that chat
as an auditor or claim an audit it did not perform. Normal PR review and required CI
remain applicable. Sol6.1 medium completed bounded processor/parser/UI work; no
DeepSeek. Preserve station/data, no installer/publication/L1/L2/paid OCR/LFS/reboot.

PR A DELIVERED: PR279 merged normally at 2026-10-29T05:52:48Z, merge

Applicable CI passed including unit/claims, Windows/runtime, native reproducibility,
a11y, operator, lint/types/security/docs/policy. Optional randomized-suite canceled
by owner pause was not made a gate. Earlier named auditor checked757/441; root fixed
its legacy checkpoint carry-forward finding in2a304e4 with focused proof. No final
258 audit by that chat is claimed. CI run40819594549 completed successfully.

Candidate B: C:/Dev/cc-pdf-processing, feat/agenda-packet-preview, based on actual
PR279 merge26c53c6a. Supported agenda-section parsing preserves 30 ordered parents/
children on pages1–4 and excludes attachments; HTML children retained too. Durable
preview/resume/cancel and authenticated original inspection precede explicit confirm.
Resume pins the original hash across amendments; incomplete results and operator
changes refuse confirmation. Other providers retain their existing import route.

Passed draft evidence (unchanged core behavior is reused): public Longmont3382,
document17338/template15247,41,472,505 bytes,258pages,SHA256

Isolated development API/SQLite workflow refreshed the real download, reused the
identical completed258-page checkpoint, previewed exact30 expected entries/pages,

and idempotent confirm. Receipt work/packet-acceptance/preview-workflow-proof.json
under coding chat cwd. Prior full258 read292.375s, interruptionafter12/resume and
local image-only OCR proof remain valid. No installed-station acceptance claimed.

Draft checks: parser11, HTML4, preview-store5 incl pinned-revision resume; router44
passed initially plus corrected legacy-source error case passed separately (one
unrelated optional skip). UI43 passed, TypeScript and affected ESLint passed after
fixing protected PDF viewing to use the credential-aware Blob helper. Original/hash
and semantic expected fixtures independently verified against rendered pages.
TownReporter pinned e07612de20cd5e035faaf2201d548d4d67da7be3; behavior reused in Python.

Integrated checks:119 passed,1 optional agenda-js-import skip in17.71s across the
six affected parser/preview/router/PrimeGov suites. Strict mypy passed all6 affected
source modules; Ruff lint/format clean. API schema/reference/types regenerated.
UI43 tests, TypeScript and affected ESLint passed in the identical draft source;
TypeScript was also checked with the integrated generated API types.

PR280 open; follow-up candidate includes the two reproduced corrections below.
Remaining: applicable required CI and normal merge. No extra broad suites/audit
ladder. No station processes started.

PR280 initial head13860373: normal GitHub review identified old parent-only import
order collisions. Red reproduction confirmed the17-to30-item mismerge; confirmation
now refuses numbering/order conflicts before writing and preserves matching edited
items. Actual browser acceptance also reproduced Windows AccessDenied during JSON
replacement while polling; bounded310ms sharing-error retry preserves atomic records.
Affected preview/document regressions15pass; affected strict mypy clean. Final
browser proof passed after correcting the isolated SQLite fixture to attach a real
file-backed schema (the first fixture used an in-memory attached schema). The old
failed preview stayed unchanged; no baseline rebinding. A fresh normal-UI preview
reused the same original/258-page checkpoint with zero parser workers. Before confirm:
zero items,30 exactpreview titles/pages; authenticated UI Blob41472505bytes/exactSHA,
30page links. Actual UI confirm stored30items; serverrestart preservedall30. Native
headless PDF popup reached commit/networkidle, but viewer DOMContentLoaded did not
fire; do not claim a PDF-viewer DOM assertion. Receipt/screenshots under coding-chat
work/packet-acceptance/browser-workflow-proof.json. No station changes.
Optional live-network CI received Longmont HTTP403 for both list endpoints from
GitHub runner (7others passed); no optional gate or retry added. Current Coder is
watcher/nudger only. Agent document_processor owns the bounded browser proof and
must stop its hidden development helpers after it; root owns follow-up commit/CI.

# CivicCast current handoff — October 27, 2026

Owner standing instruction: maintain the coordinator failure log at C:/Users/scott/Documents/Codex/2026-10-19/i-cannot-get-astra-to-finish-2/outputs/CODEX-FAILURE-LOG.md. Record future directive violations/material avoidable mistakes with evidence and impact for a possible OpenAI report; do not publish without instruction.

## CURRENT — DELIVERED: PR277 REVIEW CORRECTIONS (PR278) — October 28, 2026

DELIVERED. PR #278 https://github.com/scottconverse/civiccast-native/pull/278 merged to
`main` at 2026-10-28T23:46:47Z: merge commit `ba80846330108bf300e48bb64507b748c099b8d7`,
merged source head `065599fe4d5e0d6a7e7b1cf339e422a4a73c620d` (ordinary merge, no
admin/bypass/auto; one ordinary follow-up commit after the bounded review, no force push).
Required CI on `065599fe`: 20 checks passed, 3 packaging-only checks skipped, none failed
(Unit tests, claims-evidence verifier, Windows native guard, WS4, Two independent Windows
workspaces, reproducibility, lint/type, security, operator, a11y, docs, policy). Optional
agenda-integration and randomized suites also passed; neither is a gate. Main head verified
as `ba808463` locally and via `git ls-remote`.

This local receipt carries root's earlier local Phase 1 completion record (still below,
historical) and was not pushed as a bookkeeping-only commit, so CI was not restarted for it.

Owner ordered ONE focused correction PR for three automated-review findings reproduced
against final PR277 head `3de427a5`. DeepSeek Flash1017-cloud LOW is sole serial executor;
root coordinates. Branch `fix/pr277-review-corrections` from actual current main
`6d43e9a7` (PR277 merge). Scope is only these three defects plus their regressions and the
affected docs/types; no Phase 2, no installer/release/tag/publication, no LFS/spending, no
station API/probe/DB/restart/install action, no frozen-candidate edits.

CORRECTION 1 — failed page could still be imported as complete
(`civiccast/agenda_import/docparse.py`). Diagnosis: a page whose `extract_text()` raised was
replaced by empty text, so a document with a lost middle page reported `partial=False`/
`reason=None` whenever any other page yielded numbered items, and the caller persisted an
incomplete agenda. Fix: `PdfExtraction.pages_failed` records every failed page; a
non-zero count always ends as `partial=True` — `reason="page_failed"` when items were
recovered from other pages, `reason="unreadable"` when EVERY page failed (the existing
"nothing usable" outcome). `PrimeGovSource` refuses either before persistence
(`pdf_partial`, now naming the unreadable page count; `pages_read` counts only pages that
yielded text). Regressions: middle-page failure, first-page failure, all-pages failure
(`tests/agenda_import/test_docparse.py`), plus a PrimeGov refusal test asserting the
partial result never reaches the mapper (`test_primegov.py`).

CORRECTION 2 — text budget skipped single/final pages
(`civiccast/agenda_import/docparse.py`). Diagnosis: the overrun check ran after the page
was parsed and appended and only when another page remained, so a single-page or
oversized FINAL page bypassed the 2,000,000-character cap and imported as complete. Fix:
the remaining budget is checked BEFORE each page's text is parsed or appended, on every
page; an overrun sets `partial=True`/`text_limit` and the page is never parsed, so no
partial item list is produced. Text totalling exactly the limit is complete when every page
was covered (no off-by-one in either direction). Hard subprocess timeout, page cap and
other providers' legacy `extract_items_from_pdf` are unchanged. Regressions: single-page
overrun, final-page overrun, exactly-at-limit completion (`test_docparse.py`) and a real
subprocess single-page overrun refused before import (`test_primegov.py`, tiny budget).

CORRECTION 3 — discovered archived year could not be imported
(`primegov.py`, `router.py`, operator `AgendasScreen.tsx`). Diagnosis: `since` selects any
archived year for discovery, but the import lookup searched only the current year and the
two prior ones, so a meeting discovered with e.g. `since=2023-01-01` in 2026 returned
not-found. Fix: smallest compatible explicit year context — optional PrimeGov-only
`archive_year` field on the existing import-external body (rejected 422 for the other
vendors or for a future archive year; years 1 through the current UTC year are supported), forwarded through the
`AgendaSource.fetch_agenda` Protocol keyword (other adapters accept and ignore it), and used
by `_find_meeting` as the primary archive year (upcoming + that year + current year = at
most three finite lists). The operator console sends the selected meeting's year (else the
`since` year) for PrimeGov only, and shows a one-line hint naming the finite scope. Provider
ids, dedup, explicit operator selection and partial-failure warnings are unchanged; blank
`since` keeps the previous current-year discovery and current/current-1/current-2 import
behavior. Regression: discovery of an archived meeting three years older than the current
year is offered, is NOT findable by the pre-correction lookup, and imports with the explicit
year (`test_primegov.py`), plus router tests for forwarding/rejection (`test_router.py`) and
a UI payload test (`AgendasScreen.test.tsx`). Generated `docs/openapi.json`,
`docs/API-REFERENCE.md` and `api.generated.ts` regenerated with the repo script;
`docs/ops/agenda-import-runbook.md` updated for the bounded/page-failed and finite-year
behavior.

REVIEW FINDINGS CORRECTED (bounded independent read-only DeepSeek review of candidate
`87154b03`, coordinator outputs `deepseek-phase1-correction-review/result.json`; the reviewer
confirmed corrections 1 and 2 by reading and filed two MATERIAL outcome-3 findings, both
year-scope boundary mismatches):

- Finding 1 (high) - the upcoming list is not year-filtered, so discovery can offer a meeting
  dated in the NEXT calendar year; the console then sent that future year as `archive_year` and
  the import was refused 422. Corrected: an offered upcoming meeting needs no archive year at
  all (the import lookup always reads the upcoming list first), so the console sends the year
  only when it is a valid archived-list year (current or earlier) and sends none otherwise.
  Regression: `AgendasScreen.test.tsx` "next-year upcoming meeting sends no archive year", plus
  `test_primegov.py` "next-year upcoming meeting is importable without a year scope".
- Finding 2 (medium) - an arbitrary 1990 import floor was not shared with discovery (`since`),
  so a `since` before 1990 offered meetings import refused 422. Corrected: the invented floor is
  gone; one shared rule in `primegov.archive_year_supported()` (current UTC year or any earlier,
  floor = year 1, i.e. every year a `since` date can express) is used by BOTH the import request
  validation and (via `_archive_year`'s clamp) discovery, so the offered set and the importable
  set are identical. Regressions: `test_primegov.py` "archived year before the old floor is
  offered and importable" and `test_router.py` "a year below the old floor is accepted". No
  unbounded scan: the import still reads at most three finite archive lists, and the future-year
  rejection remains for genuinely invalid input.

EVIDENCE REUSED (not re-fetched): the recorded real Longmont eight-item agenda import
(meeting3443/template15544) and the 41,472,505-byte/258-page packet from
coordinator `outputs/deepseek-primegov-phase1/result.json` and the retained TEMP receipt.
This correction does not invalidate them: the defaults (500 pages / 2,000,000 characters),
the 258-page packet's "not partial" outcome, and the eight-item extraction are unchanged by
the budget-check reordering, and no document was downloaded again.

OWNED JOBS: none. Final-head required CI40781932797 and companion checks are terminal green; PR278 merged normally. Executor and bounded reviewer are terminal. Root independently verified merged identity and 20 successful/3 expected skipped checks. Regression receipt: coordinator outputs/deepseek-phase1-corrections/result.json; read-only review: outputs/deepseek-phase1-correction-review/result.json. No reruns or station actions.

NEXT ACTION: none owed for this correction; await owner direction. Do not start Phase 2,
packaging, or any station action automatically. No owned job remains (the only owned job was
the PR278 required-CI run on `065599fe`, which reached its terminal green state; no local
watcher process is left running).

## HISTORICAL — PHASE 1 DELIVERED — October 28, 2026

P1 public PrimeGov PDF retrieval, P2 bounded download/extraction, and P3 archived/upcoming discovery are implemented and merged. Phase 2 is not started.

- PR277: https://github.com/scottconverse/civiccast-native/pull/277
- Final source head: 3de427a5628c924d2a89290a61f101bbb48382be.
- Verified merge: 6d43e9a70e253586191d6ecbc9eadf22778b37f5, October 28 at 16:43:02 UTC.
- Required CI40716937602: Unit tests, Windows native guard and claims-evidence passed. All applicable lint, security, operator, accessibility, docs, policy and reproducibility checks passed. Three packaging-only checks skipped as expected. Optional agenda integration and randomized checks also passed; neither was promoted to a gate.
- Windows first attempt rejected a hosted-runner WSL AppxManifest.xml sampled handle during closure provisioning. Its one failed-job-only retry passed; successful Unit/claims evidence was reused. No product workaround or checker weakening.

Delivered behavior: null document links use templateId/compileOutputType to construct the public PDF URL; explicit links and HTML remain supported; agendas rank ahead of packets/minutes. PDFs download with a 100 MiB cap and 180-second streamed budget. Extraction has 500-page/2-million-character caps and a hard 60-second subprocess timeout that terminates a stuck parser. Unreadable/oversize/partial results return honest errors and cannot silently replace a complete agenda. Discovery merges upcoming meetings and one requested/current archive year, deduplicates IDs, shows partial-result warnings and errors when both lists fail. Redirects use the existing literal-host guard on every hop; DNS-rebinding protection is not claimed.

Actual workflow: isolated development FastAPI router and temporary SQLite database, real Longmont provider. Discovery returned 282 meetings (5 upcoming, 277 archived). Archived meeting3443/template15544 imported eight ordered agenda items with the correct source URL. Cancellation-only meeting3489 returned an explanation and stored zero items. The recorded 41,472,505-byte/258-page packet was read without truncation; its 210 extracted numbered lines prove resource-bound compatibility, not semantic validation of 210 agenda items. The changed subprocess path also returned the eight-item agenda successfully. Focused Python/UI/static checks passed; see the executor receipt for exact command-level results.

Limitations: extraction recognizes flat digit-numbered lines, not arbitrary layout/OCR or ITEM-prefixed/split-number headings. Such PDFs return pdf_no_items honestly. Import lookup automatically searches the current and previous two archive years. The real walkthrough used an isolated API/database, not an installed browser session. No installer, release, tag, LFS transfer or running-station action occurred.

Evidence: coordinator outputs/deepseek-primegov-phase1/result.json and activity.jsonl; retained temporary workflow receipt under %TEMP%/phase1-primegov/receipt.json. The owned temporary database was removed. DeepSeek Flash1017-cloud LOW performed engineering/checks; coordinator independently confirmed GitHub merge and final check conclusions. No independent review was claimed.

No owned job remains. Next action: await owner direction; do not start Phase 2 or packaging automatically. This local handoff completion update is bookkeeping only and does not justify another build or CI run.

Historical task records below are retained for provenance and are not the current task state.
## HISTORICAL - IN FLIGHT: workflow-policy assertion fix for required CI Unit - October 27, 2026

Owner authorized (DeepSeek LOW sole executor, root coordinates) fixing the required
CI failure introduced alongside merged PR #275 and getting required CI green, with
no extra tests, no rebuild, no LFS, no spending and no station action.

- DIAGNOSIS (from existing log, not re-run): main `346605a0` source CI run
  `40629526280`, job `Unit tests`, `11806 passed, 106 skipped, 5 deselected`.
  Single failure `tests/policy/test_native_beta_candidate_workflow.py:307`
  `assert text.count(reviewed_download) == 1` -> `0 == 1` in
  `test_native_beta_candidate_workflow_builds_signed_artifacts_without_publishing`.
  That assertion hardcoded the pre-#275 reuse command
  `gh release download $env:REVIEWED_RELEASE --repo $env:GITHUB_REPOSITORY --pattern native-app-payload.ccpack --dir $reuse`.
  PR #275 deliberately moved the reviewed PyAV wheel to its own 4 MB release asset,
  so the workflow step now reads
  `--pattern $env:REVIEWED_WHEEL_NAME --dir $reuse`. Workflow behavior is correct
  and strictly better (no mutable product pack in a CI build input, download-only);
  the stale policy assertion was the only failure. Product code, signing,
  installer bytes and published acceptance evidence are unaffected.
  The downstream claims-verifier failure is missing JUnit evidence from the failed
  producer (job never executed its JUnit-upload step), not a product/tests failure.
  Optional randomized suite failure stays NON-GATE; not run, not fixed, not waited on.
- CANDIDATE: branch `fix/policy-reuse-download-assertion` from exact main
  `346605a0409988f1f86e4845e04e82b10d970deb`. CHANGED BEHAVIOR: one policy
  assertion now expects the actual reviewed-wheel download line and additionally
  pins the step's `REVIEWED_WHEEL_NAME` to `av-18.0.0-cp311-abi3-win_amd64.whl`.
  Unchanged and still asserted: exactly one `gh release` occurrence in the
  producer (that download), no `gh api`, no publish/upload/edit verb, no
  `--allow-development-key`, signing/trust-root/artifact/checksum/reuse safeguards.
  The wheel pin itself is NOT repinned or undone (`0f9427a4...`/4,347,090 bytes).
- EVIDENCE REUSED: PR #275 merge `346605a0`; the same run's `11806` passing tests;
  WS4 and "Two independent Windows workspaces" already passed on that head;
  published installer `8fdce69e`/`2c6d2614...` correct and untouched.
- OWNED JOB: required `ci-test` on this branch's PR (Unit + applicable claims/
  security jobs), triggered by the branch push only - no manual dispatch, no
  signing build, no rebuild. Expected terminal: PR required checks green.
  Cancel method if mis-owned/wedged: `gh run cancel <run id>` for that run only.
  Exact run/PR identities are recorded at receipt below rather than in a second
  bookkeeping commit, so CI is not restarted for documentation.
- NEXT STEP: normal reviewable PR, bounded watch of the auto-triggered required
  checks, then normal merge; no admin/bypass, no tag/release/rebuild/station work.

## HISTORICAL — DELIVERED: Beta20 recovery-fix package published — October 27, 2026

Scott authorized publishing the prepared signed Beta20 (source `8fdce69e`, build
`40616252842`, setup SHA-256 `2c6d2614...388e4b`) and updating public download
links, with no rebuild, re-sign, extra test, LFS transfer, spending or
host-station action. Sole executor: DeepSeek LOW
`work/deepseek-beta20-publish.py` (activity/state in
`outputs/deepseek-beta20-publish/`); root coordinates only.

Routine decision under the delegated rule — revision convention. The
`v1.0.0-beta.20` tag and release already exist (tag target
`a17449189a39af6474d914137eab020169f91023`, PR #259 publication, revised
October 22 for documentation).
- Option A — new revision tag `v1.0.0-beta.20.1` plus a new release. Pro:
  distinct tag identity for the new bytes. Con: no existing convention for a
  patch tag on this line, a second 26-asset release (or an incomplete
  complete-kit set), a release-truth `current` switch and extra history.
- Option B — in-place asset revision of the existing published release, keeping
  the tag and its history, exactly as the October 22 documentation revision did
  (its truth note already reads "use revision source for this package" with the
  original tag target unchanged). Pro: existing convention, tags/history
  preserved, public links stay valid, complete kit stays available, no new
  release infrastructure. Con: published bytes change under one tag, mitigated
  by explicit revision-source notes in the release body, truth manifest and
  verification record. **Recommended and taken.**
- Option C — move/force the existing tag. Forbidden by policy; not considered.
No tag was created, moved or deleted, so no tag/release workflow hook could fire
a duplicate build; this repo's workflow triggers are workflow_dispatch,
PR/branch-push and workflow_run, none tag-based.

DELIVERED (public):
- Release `https://github.com/scottconverse/civiccast-native/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.20`
  remains published (not draft), prerelease, tag target
  `a17449189a39af6474d914137eab020169f91023`, 26 assets.
- Installer
  `https://github.com/scottconverse/civiccast-native/releases/download/v1.0.0-beta.20/setup.exe`
  SHA-256 `2c6d261445567c168ad9f7fa7bdbd085b5dc8f8d5bcda59e41cde86ac6388e4b`
  (GitHub asset digest matches the prepared bytes), revision source `8fdce69e`,
  build 40616252842, installed payload carries merged PR #273.
- Provenance tag `archive/v1.0.0-beta.20-package-revision-20261027` (annotated) points at the exact revision source
  `8fdce69e4fccfba80f2984a0d034d8851b4840e0`. It is a provenance marker only: no
  release, no assets, no version change; the published `v1.0.0-beta.20` tag stays at
  `a17449189a39af6474d914137eab020169f91023`. No workflow in this repository filters
  on `tags:`, so pushing it triggers no build.
- Nine assets replaced with the prepared bytes (setup, sidecar, app-payload and
  server-binaries packs, four manual files, SHA256SUMS.txt); the other 17,
  including all 12 station-model parts, `station-models.json`, the
  CUDA/FFmpeg/Ollama packs and the downloader, are unchanged and keep their
  original published digests. 26 assets, 26,921,298,251 bytes.
- Public download surfaces updated: release notes (revision section),
  `docs/releases/release-truth.yaml`,
  `docs/releases/v1.0.0-beta.20-verification.md`, `README.md`. Existing landing
  page/install-guide download URLs were already correct and unchanged.
- Accepted evidence reused, not repeated: isolated Sandbox lifecycle acceptance,
  signatures, source CI 40583199781, PR #273 merge. Informational Gate A
  40620078397 and the optional randomized suite remain non-gates. No long-soak
  requalification and no host-station action.
- Live station, tags/history and unrelated dirty work (soak/YouTube evidence,
  coordinator failure log, .tmp files) preserved.

PUBLICATION-INDUCED CI COUPLING - CORRECTED (no rebuild, no re-pin, no re-sign):
- Symptom: `native-app-reproducibility` / "Two independent Windows workspaces"
  (run 40628662572) failed on PR #274's head and on main pushes after publication.
- Cause: its reuse step downloaded `native-app-payload.ccpack` from release
  `v1.0.0-beta.20` and required the embedded `av-18.0.0-cp311-abi3-win_amd64.whl`
  to equal the reviewed pin 0f9427a4.../4,347,090 bytes. The revised pack carries
  the self-hosted lane's advisory-built wheel (4,346,966 bytes / f4fb5079...; same
  pinned PyAV sdist and FFmpeg commit in its own provenance file, advisory hash by
  documented policy). So a CI build input depended on a mutable product pack.
- Correction taken (root-recommended option under the delegated rule): the exact
  reviewed wheel bytes were retrieved - not rebuilt - from the retained pack
  `outputs/beta20-documentation-revision/kit/packs/native-app-payload.ccpack`,
  validated against the existing pin (4,347,090 bytes / 0f9427a4...) and published
  as their own small release asset `av-18.0.0-cp311-abi3-win_amd64.whl` on
  `v1.0.0-beta.20` (GitHub asset digest matches the pin; 4.3 MB, no pack re-upload).
  Both reuse steps now download that asset directly and keep every existing
  reviewed size/hash assertion (`EXPECTED_WHEEL_BYTES`/`EXPECTED_WHEEL_SHA256` read
  from `scripts/build_native_pyav_wheel.py`, plus the reviewed wheel name).
- The asset is CI provenance/reuse only: not part of the installable kit, never
  installer-required, and deliberately not listed in `SHA256SUMS.txt`, which stays
  the checksum authority for the 26-asset kit. Release notes, verification record,
  release truth and `docs/handoff/BUILD-ASSETS.md` now separate the two sets.
- Superseded: the earlier rebuild recommendation is withdrawn. No product rebuild,
  no wheel re-pin, no re-sign, no installer change, no new tag/release, no station
  action. Preserve this asset across future revisions instead of replacing it.

DeepSeek LOW performed corrections and normal merge. Local affected checks158passed.
Station hotfix remains installed; earlier600-probe/reload/all3-channel A/V

delivery continuation. No tag/publication or95hour soak requalification.
Worker began an unnecessary additional post-merge wait to strengthen evidence;

automatic security/pages jobs had started; their results are NOT claimed here.
Existing report: docs/ops/black-silent-hotfix-2026-10-27.md and evidence JSON.
Reason for outage/fix: repeated DLL-directory registrations exhausted Windows
loader search list, preventing reload/recovery; locked per-directory registration
cache prevents repeated registrations. Local backed-up module hotfix is active,
not a newly published signed installer. This work is delivered; historical
checkpoints below are not instructions to restart it.

## Application-upgrade checkpoint — October 27, 2026

PAUSED by Scott. Preparing for application upgrade does not authorize resumption.
No native DeepSeek runner is running (verified by process command line).
The watch civiccast-black-silent-fix-delivery is PAUSED. Latest branch CI runs
are terminal; PR273 has NOT merged. No work may resume until Scott says so.

Repository: C:/Dev/civiccast-f4-f6-f7
Branch: fix/black-silent-20261027
HEAD: 8ee3c4f16660fb076479289e00edb0a5c2375a4e
PR: https://github.com/scottconverse/civiccast-native/pull/273
Required CI run40574997367 failed Unit tests, WS4 Windows guard, and downstream
claims verifier. Optional randomized failure is not an added gate.
Unit failure: new deterministic test patched global os.name, breaking POSIX path
validation; second new real-loader test skipped where no installed runtime exists,
which the existing pure-suite gate rejects. Worker left an UNCOMMITTED correction
in tests/native/test_gstreamer_runtime.py: module-local os shim and removal of
the CI-inapplicable real-loader test; 12 focused checks passed on this Windows host.
This does not prove Linux CI or explain the separate WS4 missing-JUnit failure.
Worker stopped during native collection counts; no completed result is available.
On explicit resumption, inspect preserved diff and actual WS4 failure logs; finish
only concrete required corrections, update affected exact counts/blob bindings
together if needed, required CI, then normal merge. No unrelated checks/rebuilds.
Existing real installed600-probe/reload/A/V proof remains valid; do not repeat.
Station hotfix remains installed with backup; no station action needed for upgrade.

Execution route on resumption: ONLY DeepSeek v4.1 Flash1017-cloud via Ollama LOW.
Root coordinates. Existing runner:

Conversation/state/activity:
C:/Users/scott/Documents/Codex/2026-10-19/i-cannot-get-astra-to-finish-2/outputs/deepseek-black-silent-native/
result.json is stale phase1; do not use it as final delivery evidence.
Resume SAME conversation via DEEPSEEK_FOLLOWUP_FILE only after explicit owner
resumption. Last conversation ends with interrupted shell tool call: append an
honest tool response that count collection was interrupted/no result before asking
DeepSeek to continue. Never fabricate the missing result. Old PID10764 is dead;
never reuse that PID without ownership verification.

Preserve untracked soak/YouTube evidence and temporary work; no cleanup/reset/stash
or broad git add. Only CURRENT.md and the test file are currently modified tracked
files. No LFS, spending, installer rebuild, sandbox, reboot, physical hardware,
tags or publication. Hidden ConPTY/children; gh telemetry stays disabled.
No tests or code changes were made during application-upgrade preparation.


Delivery continuation: installed hotfix and all-channel A/V proof passed.
PR273 current head8ee3c4f1 (20:05UTC) renews six workflow-blob references
required by existing claims-policy CI after the collection-floor correction.
141 affected claims-policy checks and21 collection-policy checks passed locally.
Prior294050b9 CI exposed that binding drift; it did not complete green.
Sole DeepSeek LOW worker PID10764 owns final-head CI wait and normal merge.
No repeated outage proof, station samples, rebuilds or duplicate waiters.
This local state update needs no bookkeeping commit or CI restart.


The worker/session/route lines that used to open this file recorded the first,
now-superseded investigation pass; the outcome below replaces them. Historical
detail remains in the dated sections further down.

**Result: cause proven and corrected; the corrected Python module is deployed on
this TEST host and the installed station is verified airing real program A/V on
all three channels.** Cause is observed, not inferred: every content-reload
encoder probe re-ran `bootstrap_installed_gstreamer_runtime`, which called
`os.add_dll_directory` unconditionally; the Windows loader search path is a fixed
32,767-character buffer, so the 461st registration inside the long-running
control plane raised `FileNotFoundError [WinError 206] The filename or extension
is too long` (a 70-character, existing path) and every later probe failed
permanently. Reload dispatch therefore died, the channels pinned TRANSITIONING
with zero source-chain input while the mux kept emitting black/silent filler,
and every recovery retry re-entered the same poisoned probe.

- Source fix (branch `fix/black-silent-20261027`): per-directory registration
  guard in `civiccast/native/gstreamer_runtime.py`; red/green tests in
  `tests/native/test_gstreamer_runtime.py`; report
  `docs/ops/black-silent-hotfix-2026-10-27.md` with sanitized evidence JSON.
- Local test-host hotfix (NOT a signed package): installed
  `runtime\Lib\site-packages\civiccast\native\gstreamer_runtime.py` replaced
  through the elevated helper; the original is kept beside it as
  `gstreamer_runtime.py.bak-20261027-113835-local-hotfix`. sha256
  `ff8d8dc7adad05b9f0d433b4cea4432796083b97bee588869fd89bce1fb35e84` to
  `959540cd0c5ea8db85427666d1d6f2b898d5fa5448013ef655aaf0007fd363f6`.
  Launcher, uninstaller, manifest provenance, schedules, database and
  credentials are untouched.
- One bounded supervisor restart (11:39 MDT) released the exhausted loader
  state: all three channels returned ON_AIR on their scheduled programs, and an
  operator `reload` command on public was accepted through the previously fatal
  dispatch path, with zero dispatch errors and zero ERROR records afterwards.
- Installed FFmpeg observation at 11:41 MDT over three consecutive 2.5s segments
  per channel: all three 1280x720 H.264 + AAC; blackdetect reports no black
  segment; mean frame RGB about (120,108,100) public, (75,66,56) education,
  (77,73,75) government; mean_volume -9.7 to -21.0 dB and max -1.4 to -5.7 dB,
  against the outage signature of a black picture at -91.0 dB.
- Delivery: PR #273 (`fix/black-silent-20261027`) carries the source fix, tests, this
  ledger section and the sanitized evidence record; the required security gate failed
  on advisory drift published 2026-10-27T15:04Z (GHSA-j586-36cw-2gc2 / CVE-2026-114613,
  msgpack < 1.2.3), corrected minimally by `uv lock --upgrade-package msgpack`
  (1.2.1 -> 1.2.4, one lock block, no rebuild, no LFS). Local run of the CI gate over
  the exported lock scanned 128 packages with no findings and
  `scripts/check_pip_audit_allowlist.py` exited 0. No waiver, no allowlist entry.
- Owned background jobs: none. No endurance claim is made: the ~95h soak result
  and the historical filesrc11 cause are unchanged and not requalified.


## Current owner scope — YouTube live acceptance completed October 27

Scott requested setup and real YouTube validation. Installed Setup now holds the
existing authorized YouTube credentials. Installed Publish sent channel public to
unlisted event Ubr_pbAoTwc: YouTube active/good/live, CivicCast live, signed-out
Chrome visible moving video and non-silent decoded audio. CivicCast Stop passed;
YouTube complete/recorded. No owned sender/browser/helper remains. No code change
or rebuild. Report docs/ops/youtube-live-2026-10-27.md and matching JSON evidence.
This closes the previously deferred live YouTube check. One short run only, not
long-term endurance or caption acceptance. The historical station black/silent
failure remains UNRESOLVED; prior checklist/source delivery completion below does
not establish a fix for that operational failure. Scott deferred investigating it
until after this YouTube test. No tag/public release authorized by this test.

but are not packaged in those installed bytes. No tag or publication authorized.
Live YouTube transmission/playback remains deferred by Scott. No further work or

in the detailed execution record below.

## Current outcomes and owner authority

F1–F3, F5–F7 and N1–N8 are delivered through PR267–271; do not reopen them. F2 live
YouTube transmission/playback remains explicitly deferred, not a gate.
Scott resumed the work and explicitly directed native host installation/testing,
no sandbox, finish the goal. This supersedes the prior leave-station-untouched
restriction within that scope. Push/merge authorized; no tag/publication/release
replacement, LFS transfer/spending through October, reboot or physical hardware.

## F4 source correction and remaining causal boundary

PR272 fix/f4-reload-state-sync-20261027: code2a880a4e corrects ignored False from
sync_state_with_parent. Incoming activation now aborts through existing build-error
cleanup; outgoing elements/pads remain intact and later incoming producers never
start. Regression red before fix, green afterward. Affected ordering129pass/2skip,
policy2pass, lint/format/governed bindings pass. This does not prove original cause.
Follow-up4d14011c pins only accessibility jobs to Ubuntu24.04 after actual26.04
Playwright installation failures; no accessibility requirement was removed.
PR272 Windows CI found raw element counts79/86 during independent caption cleanup.
Correction retains raw counts, separately records exact attached children owned by
active caption retirement threads, and preserves detection of completed leftovers
and unrelated leaks. Enumeration handles RESYNC without partial counts. Five
focused cases passed; ordering133pass/2skip before the final RESYNC-only addition;
the existing three-worker/six-rollover source scenario passed69.94s (18commits,
continuity/audio/tap/clean teardown). No repeated full native run after RESYNC.
The Linux unit image is pinned to the last passing Ubuntu24.04 baseline after a
rolling-image prerequisite delay; no tests or requirements removed. Root is
waiting on final delivery head677d800f after consolidating source/evidence and the
explicit acceptance decision below. Hidden completion waiter49111 runs coordinator
work/finish-pr272.ps1: source CI40471253320, applicable check validation, exact-head

log work/pr272-merge-wait.log. Expected source CI duration can approach the last

On failure inspect actual receipt/log before another run. Cancel only this verified

Prior waiters29782,37137 and51242 are terminal. Do not start a competing merge.
The new source correction is not included in installed signed42339334 bytes.

Original run40165319415 at0fb01b0: incoming reload2 fourth clip filesrc11 errored
before readiness/commit. Outgoing playback continued; clean teardown. Raw Gst flow
debug was discarded and not uploaded. Later connected-tail abort fix is distinct.
Prior current/original-SHA/source-before-decoder-delay passes did not diagnose it.

One distinct installed experiment delayed after decodebin11 sync before manual
activation of seven NULL tails. It passed: GstBin async continuation independently
advanced tails to PLAYING during the0.5s delay, then reload2 committed with TS/audio
continuity and clean teardown. No incoming bus error. This rules out calling that
manual-delay observation a demonstrated defect; no downstream-first patch or sweep.
Evidence: C:/CivicCastTester/f4-installed-decoder-tail-delay-ready-20261027/receipt.json
and decoder-tail-debug-excerpt.log; raw worker.log retained locally,19MB.
Worker /root/f4_resume finished; no owned local test jobs remain.
The historical exact cause remains unknown. The following explicit acceptance
revision replaces that forensic clause; it does not claim the old cause was found.

## Adopted owner-delegated F4 decision — acceptance revision

Scott instructed the coordinator to record issue, options/pros/cons, recommendation
and reasons, then take that recommendation as his decision and continue. Root
communicated this decision in chat after the direct host installation and checks.
Issue: original raw flow diagnostics were discarded; the bounded experiments and
installed checks show safe replacement/recovery but cannot recover the old cause.
Options: continue open-ended reproduction (possible discovery, unbounded time and
contrary to Scott's no-loop directive); leave the item blocked indefinitely (keeps
old forensic wording, fails requested delivery); accept the historical unknown as
a documented residual risk after operational acceptance (finite evidence-based
delivery, but cannot promise that historical failure will never recur).
Recommend/adopt the third option using Scott's delegated decision authority.
This is a transparent change to F4 acceptance, not proof that the original exact-
cause requirement passed. Revised completion: demonstrated activation-refusal
containment, successful native installed replacement/failure recovery, corrected
required-CI accounting with leak detection retained, applicable green CI and merged
delivery. Historical cause remains documented; no additional timing sweep or new
gate. Operational checks passed; final CI and PR272 merge remain pending.

## Next action and coordination

Finish applicable PR272 CI and merge the demonstrated correction to close revised
F4 delivery. Preserve the accepted historical uncertainty explicitly. Do not turn
optional randomized CI into a new
gate, repeat passing scenarios, rebuild, or ask the same owner-acceptance question.
Scott delegated routine decisions via written options/pros/cons/recommendation;
that does not create missing historical evidence. Stay within concrete F4 actions.
Recurring watch civiccast-remaining-f4-delivery was successfully created; it uses
this state and newer instructions. Never resume old paused CivicCast chats.

### Historical F5 preparation / PR269 attempt2

- F4 distinction: PR268 corrected the reproduced unsafe aborted-leg teardown /
  mux hang with fenced release before NULL; native supersede and required Windows
  checks passed. Original run40165319415 attempt1 filesrc11 stream error safely
  aborted, but its source cause remains unexplained. No existing receipt proves
  that original error shares the corrected teardown cause; original diagnostic
  provenance remains unresolved under the exact F4 plan, no green-retry claim.
- PR269 attempt2 Unit121470092494 active, sole waiter23640. Public accessibility
 121459714731 cancelled after30min apt/Playwright prerequisite install, before

  physical RAM free~9.6GB; no owned local build/test process, sole gh watcher23640.
  Initial blackwell-builder selfhosted sandbox-lab runner was OFFLINE/notbusy;
  existing listener connectivity subsequently verified below, no build dispatched.
  C:/CivicCastTester/runtime-artifact-mirror contains pinned FFmpeg70.8MB,
  Ollama1.46GB, PostgreSQL334MB, TSDuck38.5MB archives. Prior candidate/kit-staging
  7d61cbede contain receipts but no current setup/packs, cannot assume ready kit.
  Complete existing beta20-documentation-revision/kit under task outputs has
  app/server/runtime packs and station floor/Whistle/Gemma/translation packs.
  Reuse unchanged verified assets; rebuild changed app/server/setup once against
  final source, no LFS/spend. Signing module0.1.8 available locally.
  Existing Run-GateA.ps1 -KitDir route avoids large downloads and keeps isolation;
  prior C:/Dev/CivicCast-TestVM evidence also exists. One vmwp process27068 exists,
  ownership not established; do not interrupt. No build/VM/install launched.
  Credential/runner presence probe: Azure/pack environment values all absent,
  Azure CLI unavailable; no local signing credential access established. Existing
  C:/actions-runner/.runner identifies blackwell-builder; credential files exist
  (values not read), no .service/runner service/task/listener process. Repo secrets
  remain in Actions. Parent selected existing configured runner route: at final
  readiness start C:/actions-runner/run.cmd in owned invisible ConPTY, record
  session/PID, verify repo runner/notbusy/no competing queued candidate, then
  dispatch existing workflow using local mirror/kit and no large uploads. This
  parent superseded the wait-to-start instruction for connectivity only. Queue=[]
  before start, config expectedrepo=true. Started existing run.cmd08:44:30UTC in
  owned invisible ConPTY86662; ListenerPID14068 parent20564, version2.337.0.
  Connected/listening; GitHub08:44:42 ONLINE/idle, no Worker. Stop owned listener
  Ctrl-C86662 after verifying ownership. No build dispatch, credential copying,
  local unsigned build, VM or station changes. CIwait23640 remains sole waiter.
  Exact future dispatch: gh workflow run native-beta-candidate-artifacts.yml
  --ref main -f build_target=self-hosted -f upload_large_artifacts=false
  -f upload_candidate_binaries=false -f prepare_only=false
  -f reuse_station_dir="C:/Users/scott/Documents/Codex/2026-10-19/i-cannot-get-astra-to-finish-2/outputs/beta20-documentation-revision/kit/station";
  empty reuse_station_run_id/reuse_station_source_sha
  (hosted-only), reviewed_pyav_release_tag only if reusing an actual reviewed tag.
  Before dispatch verify main equals approved merged final source, then verify
  returned candidate run.headSha equals it; no tag/new release. GateA automatic
  workflow_run completion uses local kit; manual gate-a-station-acceptance.yml
  --ref main -f run_id=<candidateRun> -f lane=full if needed, no duplicate lane.
  Readiness constraint from existing workflow: station model/floor/Whistle caches
  deleted on previous success and absent under actual runner _work/_temp; build
  root absent. Stock selfhosted dispatch would fetch them again. Existing complete
  kit contains their packs, but no selfhosted reuse_station input exists. Resolve
  supported local asset staging before dispatch; no new download/build performed.
  Bounded F5 preparation delta: existing builder --reuse-station-dir option and
  selfhosted workflow input now verify/reuse complete signed station packs through
  verify_station_media + verify_native_pack; same-volume hardlinks, no repacking,
  default path unchanged. Three acquisition steps/raw-rootcleanup skipped only
  for explicit selfhosted reuse. Actual existing index signature verified against
  current repo public key: beta20/key civiccast-production-2026-beta1/channelbeta,
  all6 required packs named; full pack verification runs at final reuse execution.
  Existing tiny bundle/reuse/samefile/version rejection + workflowselection2pass
  1.70s, Ruff passed. Parent material review complete; no packagebuild/signcall.
  Final isolated installed launcher/uninstaller Valid timestamped expected signer
  verification plus applicable existing install/uninstall acceptance remains.
  Consolidated PR body prepared %TEMP%/civiccast-n4-n8-f5-pr-body.md; push awaits
  PR269 merge and required CI. Actual signed installed acceptance remains.

  PR269 old head bfc4dc62 has required lint/operator/public-a11y failures;
  ci-test waiter69829 still owned (run40283658614), Windows success, unit pending.
  This is not a full CI pass. Correction now goes to the same reviewed PR.

  Repackage4pass4.03s, timing2pass1.48s. Server-search empty result now shows
  no-match; query-aware public fixture and both affected browser cases passed.

  browser cases passed. First-admin fixture still asserts the issued stored token.
  No production auth change. Explicit migration assertions advance to actual0095;
  schema/migration20pass9.30s plus remaining2pass3.04s. Ruff9files formatted/check

  feat/n4-embed-scheduled-youtube after incorporating this combined base. No live
  local process or CI watcher. Next push combined PR, own one required CI waiter,
  then restore N4. F1-F4/F6/F7 merged; F5,N4-N8 remain.
- N2 implemented truthful first-recording progress from existing staff asset API,
  retry/refresh and direct Assets/Publish/resident links. Sources select current
  named channel profiles; stale selection falls back to a current profile.
  Accepted source/media says Saved, with no playback/publication claim.

  station interruption, downloads or installer builds. Setup UI43pass with one
  new exact-label fixture mismatch; corrected source test2pass. TypeScript and
  affected ESLint passed. No further local test expansion needed; parent material
  review complete. Docs/API/source checks remain as applicable.
- README/install guide state required components, preparation100GB/models22GB,
  progress-log and interrupted/mismatched-file recovery, preserve offline kit and
  upgrades. Optional-model feasibility: requires coordinated signed six-component
  activation/runtime contract; deferred, no acquisition implementation.

- N3 implemented selected batch max10 through existing serial queue, truthful
  state/cue/error progress, cancel/resume with retained review decisions, source
  cue timing edits and stored local vocabulary reaching supported Whisper paths.
  Migration0095 persists cancelled; conditional worker saves preserve cancellation.
  Checks immediately before attach/CDN stop work cancelled during translation;
  already-started publication may finish, documented in UI/help.

- Timing-only English change invalidates derived Spanish interval approval.
  Shared recorded identity includes interval; legacy target-only edits capture
  immutable English source-window association (nullable0095 review columns), so
  intended target timing and unchanged approvals survive. Existing offline suite
  70pass4.98s; correction20pass/1external-PG-skip7.21s; durable provenance restart

  No local jobs live. N3 DCO2dc66e85 committed after these focused checks;
  required CI now runs once for the combined reviewed N1-N3 candidate.

  Parent authorized N1 checks alongside hosted CI after headroom check (11GB free).

## Active F4/F6/F7 checkpoint — October 25, 2026

- Scott explicitly resumed this work in the parent Codex chat; the earlier chat
  remains paused and must not be messaged. Parent owns the complete roadmap;
  this directly controlled worker owns only F4/F6/F7. F1–F3 are merged; F5 and
  N1–N8 remain pending. No tags, publication, installer build or station changes.
- N7 selection for later work: Spanish, Chinese, Tagalog/Filipino, Vietnamese,
  Arabic (top five US languages besides English). Preserve existing Spanish;
  specify supported Chinese written variants honestly during N7 implementation.
- Candidate: `fix/f4-f6-f7-transitions-preview-captions` in
  `C:\Dev\civiccast-f4-f6-f7`, based on current main
  `6f1e13a0b0954d525829fe3f562a73b99ddb6f26`; PR #267 confirmed merged.
- F4 remains unresolved: first-attempt run40165319415 replacement filesrc11
  stream error aborts the replacement safely; Gst debug detail was discarded.
  Exact log: C:\Users\scott\AppData\Local\Temp\civiccast-f4-historical.log.
  Baseline native session51334 passed, as did one bounded scheduling probe;
  neither proves a fix. Pending-reload log now preserves URI-redacted Gst detail.
- F6 implemented: standalone CG HLS explicitly unavailable (503, null paths,
  truthful UI/help), layout preview and on-air graphics preserved. Focused checks
  passed in affected batch140 tests (six expected platform skips).
- F7 implemented program fencing for WAV/ASR/WebVTT/feed/embedded commands at
  actual reload switch. Native decode caught233 ms outgoing-caption carryover;
  direct cc_data erase reduced it to100 ms but still failed session49269.
  Packet capture proves erase arrives three frames late. cccombiner retains its
  scheduling FIFO across request-pad replacement (upstream gstcccombiner.c).
- Current correction disables the extra FIFO only for live appsrc captions;
  timestamp aggregation remains. Same interval proof session43974 PASSED in25.33s,

  Strategy initially20 gi-import failures when runtime env omitted, corrected
  by declaring the existing runtime. API/manual artifacts generated, including
  in-product/PDF/DOCX. Parent final material review found a missing daemon token passthrough; fixed

## Active F1–F3 delivery checkpoint — October 25, 2026
- OAuth resumption: Scott authorized using civiccast1@gmail.com in Chrome and
  subsequently explicitly approved creating its YouTube channel. Created Google
  project `keen-apogee-512802-i5` (CivicCast YouTube), configured an external/testing
  OAuth app and desktop client, enabled YouTube Data API, and added only this account
  as a test user. Scott completed consent. Desktop PKCE + validated-state loopback
  callback succeeded; OAuth refresh and channel API both return HTTP 200.
  Credentials are local in an ACL-protected private directory, outside the repository;
  no secret values are recorded here or in chat. The existing Setup save function
  wrote isolated credentials; the real adapter consumed them without OAuth env vars.
  Created channel CivicCast, handle @CivicCast1, ID `UCIsN1mKqtpMNpvoh8GPSXkQ`.
  Scott completed phone verification; the correct-account verification screen
  confirms it. Refreshed Studio for this exact channel/account. Its live-access
  request is now active: requested October 25, 2026 at 9:01 PM America/Denver;
  observed countdown "Only 23:59:51 until you can stream". Expected availability
  October 26 around 9:01 PM Denver time, subject to Google's actual activation.
  OAuth refresh, channels.list and now liveBroadcasts.list return HTTP 200; the
  list response does not establish permission to start while Studio's countdown
  remains active. No event or sender created. Scott explicitly accepted F2 setup
  and implementation: real streaming is NOT required for sign-off and this delay
  is NOT a blocker. A later destination/viewer/stop rehearsal remains a follow-up,
  without touching the endurance run.
  No active watcher, callback, test sender or automatic continuation is running.
  No billing, station changes, installer, release, or merge. OAuth callback helper
  session 92399 finished successfully; earlier blocked attempt 29891 was cancelled.

- Delivered: review-ready PR267 https://github.com/scottconverse/civiccast-native/pull/267
  on branch `fix/f1-f3-caption-publish-dependencies`, head
  `29a1d373b52bf25cd6fdfd3e893308ade2c4a799`. PR is OPEN, non-draft, merge state CLEAN.
  All new commits have DCO sign-off. **Do not merge, tag, release, rebuild an installer,
  or update/restart the endurance station.** Scott revised F2 acceptance to accept
  the completed setup without a real streaming check. F1/F2/F3 are accepted; finish
  the requested setup-manual documentation and its required CI/PR delivery.
- Worktree: `C:/Dev/civiccast-f1-f3`; original checkout and its pre-existing handoff
  remain preserved. Baseline main `933dd657`; plan commit `7edc5500`. One executor;
  current-agent routing skill applied; no independent reviewer was commissioned.
- F1 VERIFIED: original review missed fixes already in main (`5c3540ec`, `5ca75521`).
  Retained package-timeline clipping/rebasing and approved-source repackaging gates.
  Added real FFmpeg fractional-trim + bilingual-caption regression: removed head/tail
  excluded, retained cues align to 0–0.167 and0.467–0.567 seconds, originals unchanged.
  Existing trim/repackage/review regressions passed; no caption engine was replaced.
- F2 ACCEPTED BY OWNER; LIVE REHEARSAL IS FOLLOW-UP: protected Setup values now feed existing
  IA/YouTube/NAS/SMTP adapters with environment fallback and explicit provider override.
  Added required YouTube refresh-token and optional SMTP fields; webhook-only setup
  remains compatible. No secrets copied into environment or returned in Setup responses.
  Publish selects a channel with fresh HLS and sends its existing audio/video through
  a separate owned FFmpeg RTMPS process to a configured/bound YouTube event. Current
  start/title/privacy/auto-start/stop metadata, viewer links, destination-confirmed
  lifecycle, two-minute startup timeout, process/destination failure, stop/shutdown,
  restart interruption, partial setup cleanup and private ingest-link redaction are
  covered. Thirty-second destination polling limits quota use; UI reads local status.
  Conditional surface writes preserve concurrent publishing; dashboard reads stay
  batched. Simulated and historical unconfirmed YouTube results remain unverified.
  Provider/output failures leave local portal publication available.
- F2 proof and acceptance: real Google OAuth refresh, channels.list and
  liveBroadcasts.list return HTTP 200; the authorized channel is @CivicCast1.
  Existing Setup save securely feeds the real adapter without OAuth environment
  variables. Scott completed phone verification. Studio's activation countdown is
  recorded above. Contract tests and the real local FFmpeg/RTMP receiver establish
  local starting/live/stopped lifecycle and transport. No actual YouTube stream or
  viewer playback is claimed. Scott explicitly removed that check as a sign-off
  requirement and said to count F2 as a win; the earlier blocked audit is superseded.
- Documentation follow-up: expanded the setup chapter with account/channel
  selection, project/API setup, OAuth app/client/test-user creation, desktop PKCE
  helper, protected three-field storage, testing-token expiry, phone verification,
  Studio account selection/activation and later rehearsal/stop. Corrected related
  obsolete provider/publishing claims. Regenerated the assembled, in-product and
  downloadable manual artifacts. Helper is an IT source-checkout tool, not a new
  installer feature; focused callback/security checks pass (4 cases).
- F3 VERIFIED: targeted package updates only; uv changes exactly four resolved versions.
  Native app lock changes only pypdf/filelock/setuptools, runtime lock only setuptools;
  existing single LGPL PyAV wheel retained and app lock hash updated. Security floors
  are scoped to captions-runtime/dev groups so global uv settings cannot contaminate
  hash-required native staging. All four current-head CI security scans pass; both npm
  audits are zero. Existing allowlisted NLTK PYSEC-2026-3740 remains unchanged/outside
  selected remediation. No suppression, threshold or workflow gate was changed.

- Final CI, current head: **23 passed,3 installer-related checks skipped,0 failed,

  informational randomized run40233336611 also passes; it was not promoted to a gate.
  CI URL: https://github.com/scottconverse/civiccast-native/actions/runs/40233336560
- Focused evidence retained:190 provider/publish checks;39 sample/lifecycle checks;

  and69 public UI tests; operator build and both frontend linters; pinned Ruff/mypy
  (725 source files); generated OpenAPI/lock currency; no claims blob/marker drift.
  A stale public test assertion was reproduced on both old/new Vitest then corrected
  to existing wording. CI exposed two old auth/installer fixtures omitting the new
  refresh token; both were reproduced and corrected, retaining role/redaction checks.
  Required unit work finished before that test-only push. No broad manual rerun,
  unrelated repair, mutation testing or new gate was added.
- Installed environments retain current packages. Applying F3 later needs a separate
  owner-authorized installed app/runtime update from corrected locks, including
  caption-environment filelock where present. No installed package was changed here.
- All owned checks, software receiver/sender, browser helpers and CLI watchers are
  terminal. Last watcher79306 / wait179 returned0. No automatic continuation is
  promised. Scratch receipts remain under original chat `work/f1-f3-*`.
- Next: deliver this manual/helper follow-up on the same PR and complete its
  required checks. F1/F2/F3 acceptance no longer waits for YouTube activation or
  real streaming. Reuse prior passing evidence for unchanged implementation.
  A later live rehearsal is follow-up, not a blocker. No F4-F7/N-series work,
  merge, release, installer, LFS transfer, spending or installed-station changes.


## Historical restart checkpoint — October 25, 2026

Scott requested preparation for context compaction and a Codex app update/restart.
This checkpoint is a local documentation change only; it has not been committed
or pushed, and must not automatically trigger another PR or CI cycle.

- Checkout: `C:\Dev\civiccast-native`, branch `fix/brotli-agenda-advisory`,
  HEAD `0fb01b0bc51bfa648dac2fc419890fd3d18d15f2`.
- Fetched `origin/main`: `933dd6571ab57ee5891f76c1148b79cb9c77bbc0`.
  PR265 (checker/handoff) and PR266 (targeted Brotli) are merged. Both authorized
  delivery tasks are complete; there is no pending merge, build or release.
- **Leave the endurance station running.** Scott explicitly said it is a test
  station to see how long it runs without issues. Do not update its installed
  packages, restart its processes/services, reinstall, reboot, stress-test, or
  interrupt it. At this checkpoint `CivicCastSupervisor` is Running, PID12084.
- No owned CI watcher/helper remains running. Wait sessions78744,94426,19473
  are terminal; the final watcher confirmed the PR266 merge. A process-name/
  command-line probe found no visible Python checker/Brotli wait helper.
- No installer rebuild, new release, LFS transfer, or installed-station package
  update was performed. The Codex app update/restart itself was not initiated.
- Latest requested review is complete: specs, records, current source, open
  issues/PRs, and five related repositories were inspected read-only. Scott has
  **not authorized implementing the resulting backlog**. Resume by reading the
  report and the next owner instruction, not by starting repairs automatically.
- Full review and source references:
  `C:\Users\scott\Documents\Codex\2026-10-24\us\outputs\civiccast-unfinished-work-review-2026-10-25.md`.
  Brotli investigation/merge receipts:
  `C:\Users\scott\Documents\Codex\2026-10-24\us\outputs\civiccast-brotli-investigation.md`.
- Main findings: other dependency advisories; trimmed-recording caption timeline;
  fixed/nonexistent CG preview segments; installed native launcher unsigned
  (read-only signature check); intermittent replacement-program test failure;
  native-app audience beacons missing; incomplete field workflow evidence; five
  unreconciled open PRs; stale current-status records. Distinguish confirmed
  defects, static source gaps, missing proof and owner-deferred work.
- TownLight integration is owner-deferred to2.0. Historical WSL/macOS/audit-role
  obligations do not revive retired work or superseded workflow gates. No new
  release requirements or automatic audit/delegation were authorized.
- Scott requested the `codex-model-routing-1024` skill for this session:
  `C:\Users\scott\.codex\skills\codex-model-routing-1024\SKILL.md`.
  Keep the suitable current agent; no automatic delegation/model change. Keep
  Windows helpers hidden and gh inside invisible ConPTY (`tty=true`,
  `login=false`), preserve disabled telemetry, no host reboot, no LFS spending.

The following entries retain their original preparation/history scope. This
restart checkpoint and the confirmed merge receipts supersede pending wording.

## Completed follow-up — targeted Brotli correction

The checker integration below is complete: PR265 merged into main at
`f9d380bebb15489762424f4f1293f4e6f050211a` after current-head unit tests,
Windows probes and claims verification passed (test run `40161873024`).
Earlier pending/failure notes below describe preparation, not the final result.

Scott subsequently authorized the Brotli dependency fix through a PR and merge
after required CI, with no installer rebuild or new release. Branch
`fix/brotli-agenda-advisory` adds `brotli>=1.2.1` to `agenda-js-import` and updates
the locked decoder from 1.2.0 to 1.2.1. Only the Brotli package record and root
optional-dependency metadata change in `uv.lock`; crawl4ai remains 0.9.2 and all
other package records are identical. Native payload requirements are unchanged.

Passed local checks: `uv lock --check`; semantic comparison of all 200 locked
package records; Python 3.12 Windows x64 wheel availability in the lock; 45
`test_js_portal.py` tests (two real-crawl4ai checks skipped because that extra is
absent locally); isolated Brotli 1.2.1/HTTPX 0.28.1 compressed-response decoding;
and a focused `pip-audit --no-deps --disable-pip` scan of `brotli==1.2.1` reporting
no known vulnerabilities. No waiver or unrelated dependency upgrade is included.

PR266 merged at `2026-10-25T06:32:40Z` as
`933dd6571ab57ee5891f76c1148b79cb9c77bbc0`. Applicable CI passed, including
unit tests, claims verification, optional agenda integration, virtual headend,
publish soak, veraPDF and app-payload reproducibility. The Windows media job
initially failed on an unchanged GStreamer replacement-leg stream error, then
passed on one job-only retry without code/assertion changes. GitHub itself
returned HTTP403 for retry while the workflow was still running; that waiting
restriction was not a repository-configured rule. Test workflow40165319415,
payload reproducibility40165319416. Security40165319459 installed Brotli1.2.1
and no longer reported its advisory; independent Python/npm findings remain
failed and are not waived. Informational randomized run40165319528 was
cancelled, not passed. No independent agent review was required or performed.
No installer or release workflow was dispatched. Existing signed artifacts and
the running station are untouched.
Installed optional-extra environments need a separate package update and process
restart; merging this source fix does not patch running environments. Earlier
Brotli investigation and other security findings below remain historical evidence.

Read this file and the root `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` before continuing. This is
the current handoff, replacing dependence on the previous coordinator's local
chat and drive. Historical release records retain their original evidence scope.

## Get the complete handoff

Repository: <https://github.com/scottconverse/civiccast-native>

This handoff and the checker fix are on **`fix/beta20-portable-handoff`**, based on
published main commit `121465506a7314f02ad7572337b46a83fa3f6e51`. They are being
delivered as a branch, not represented as already merged into `main`.
Do not start from the Beta20 tag expecting the latest instructions or package source.

PowerShell, on the destination machine (choose a short writable source directory):

```powershell
$env:GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE = '1'
$env:GIT_LFS_SKIP_PUSH = '1'
git clone --single-branch --branch fix/beta20-portable-handoff https://github.com/scottconverse/civiccast-native.git civiccast-native
Set-Location civiccast-native
git status --short --branch
git log -1 --oneline
```

No `git lfs pull`, `fetch`, or `push`; no LFS transfers or spending through
October 2026. The current tree has no LFS-tracked files; historical revisions may.
The handoff branch deliberately has no PR yet: creating a PR launches broad
application CI. Scott requested a push and portable handoff, not another CI cycle
or merge. Check current remote state before later integration.

## Current result and exact identities

- **Beta20 is already public:** [release and assets](https://github.com/scottconverse/civiccast-native/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.20).
  GitHub labels it a prerelease because it is a beta; it is not a draft.
- Current installer is the documentation revision built from
  `2e19612467fda894d63e499580e4d7b5f029f5f2`, signed
  [build 39810481727](https://github.com/scottconverse/civiccast-native/actions/runs/39810481727).
  Setup SHA-256: `6c0aa52d773a4c5c0a0643e00d860a83560551d497c5f1efb05cba5beadc3e5d`.
  Existing evidence records a valid Scott Converse signature and installed Help/manual acceptance.
  See [Beta20 verification](../releases/v1.0.0-beta.20-verification.md).
- Original release tag remains at `a17449189a39af6474d914137eab020169f91023`.
  The tag's automatic source ZIP is **not** the documentation-revision source.
  Do not move the tag or rebuild an installer to reconcile these identities.
- [PR263](https://github.com/scottconverse/civiccast-native/pull/263) merged the final
  prior CI corrections at `086f1b967766aaea31a5a4296ce6f96771e2d72f`.
  Its recorded rollup was 21 successes / 3 inapplicable skips / 0 failures.
  That historical pass does not claim later CI is green.
- The approved station-manager landing page and Scott's biography are live at
  <https://scottconverse.github.io/civiccast-native/>.
  [PR264](https://github.com/scottconverse/civiccast-native/pull/264) merged at
  `121465506a7314f02ad7572337b46a83fa3f6e51`;
  [Pages run 39989225060](https://github.com/scottconverse/civiccast-native/actions/runs/39989225060)
  succeeded. Live HTTP 200, headline, biography/LinkedIn, loaded images and working
  walkthrough were checked, with no browser JavaScript errors. Six local tabs and
  390/768/1440-width layouts passed. The walkthrough is explicitly an illustration,
  not a real station demo. No customer testimonial or production-station claim was invented.

## Checker correction included in this branch

Only `scripts/verify_native_runtime_closure.py` and
`tests/native/test_closure_verifier.py` change checker behavior.

The last passing Windows run used GitHub image `20261007.264.1`; the failing run
used `20261021.278.1`. Product runtime, dependency lock, checker and workflow were
unchanged between those runs. The rejected file was Windows Terminal's root
`resources.pri`, observed as a known non-executable mapping. Six other closure
checks passed, including plugin origin and the caption embed/decode round trip.
This is a data-resource classification false positive, not evidence of a missing
media DLL. The precise Windows API that mapped the file was not captured.

The correction recognizes the stable Microsoft Windows Terminal x64 package
identity (numeric version, publisher `8wekyb3d8bbwe`) and **only root
`resources.pri`**. The path stays visible in the report. Executable and unknown
protection mappings, DLLs, wrong publishers, different packages and subdirectories
still fail. Canonical-path and file-identity safeguards are retained.

Existing verification, October 23, reused without rerunning unchanged code:

```text
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests/native/test_closure_verifier.py -q --no-cov
153 passed in 6.38s
ruff check: passed
ruff format: applied; changed files reviewed
git diff --check: passed
```

This is local checker-logic evidence, not a new hosted Windows pass or installed
product test. No installer rebuild is required for this change.

Historical Windows runs:
[passing 39923178286](https://github.com/scottconverse/civiccast-native/actions/runs/39923178286)
and [failure 39987938776](https://github.com/scottconverse/civiccast-native/actions/runs/39987938776).
The failed prerequisite caused later Windows suites to skip; missing JUnit reports
are consequences, not separate product defects. Other broad PR264 runs were cancelled
to avoid unchanged full-suite/manual work; cancellation is not a pass.

## Remaining work, not authorized as part of this handoff push

1. Integrate this branch through the repository's normal PR process when requested.
   The corrected checker has not been exercised on the updated hosted Windows image.
   Use the existing affected Windows job when integration requires it, not repeated
   full suites or a new installer. Do not claim repository-wide CI is green.
2. The Python audit reported `brotli 1.2.0 / PYSEC-2026-4322`, pulled in through
   `crawl4ai 0.9.2`. See [run 39987938274](https://github.com/scottconverse/civiccast-native/actions/runs/39987938274)
   and main security run `39989225752`. Severity, reachability and inclusion in the
   released installer were **not established** in this session. The finding has not
   been fixed or waived. Inspect the advisory and actual dependency use before a
   bounded dependency correction; do not invent an allowlist exception.

The next agent should take Scott's current assignment. Reading this handoff is not
permission to restart old nine/twelve-goal lists, redesign the product, create a
new release, or repair unrelated findings.

## Accepted behavior and boundaries to preserve

- Scott accepted the observed ~8.763-second caption sample delay and brief
  previous-program carryover for Beta20. It is not a universal latency bound and
  not a new release blocker.
- Summary evidence covers a short transcript and cited narrative; no long-meeting
  benchmark is claimed. Local AI model RAM requirements still apply.
- Roku acceptance uses the repository's software/API mocks and BrightScript
  validation. Scott explicitly prohibits physical-hardware testing requirements.
- The previous host was a test server, with owner-authorized reset/stop/start
  operations. Do not infer that a new machine is a test host without context.
- Mutation testing was removed at Scott's request. Never restore it as a CI or
  release requirement, or promote informational results into mandatory gates.
- Serial work, one justified candidate, no automatic subagents or repeated audits.
  Every additional check must address changed behavior, an unresolved requirement,
  a concrete defect or required CI. Reuse unaffected evidence and artifacts.
- No LFS transfers, new spending, host reboot or installer rebuild for this handoff.
  Keep windows/helpers hidden. No automatic monitor or continuation is required.

## Build, runtime and machine state

See [BUILD-ASSETS.md](BUILD-ASSETS.md) for exact source locations, asset sizes,
existing release downloads, the FFmpeg mirror and PyAV reuse recipe.
Source checkout and checker development do not require copying the old machine's
station data, models, installer, virtual machines, `.venv`, or agent tooling.

The old untracked `.codex/` directory is deliberately not imported. It contains
machine-specific Desktop paths, historical authorization/evidence files and
wake/completion hooks for a previous assignment. These are not product build inputs.
Current owner rules are portable in `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md`; do not recreate
old hooks or depend on `C:/Dev/codex-hook-kit` to develop CivicCast.

The previous workspace has older candidate/worktree directories. This handoff is
for the current released native product and this branch; it does not certify or
publish abandoned experiments from every historical worktree. The coordinator's
incident drafts, token-accounting reports and browser mockup scratch files are
not prerequisites. Relevant product status and evidence are linked above.

No fresh-machine build was run for this handoff. Required binary sources are
identified; availability of every third-party download and access to private
signing credentials are not implied by a successful Git clone.


## Integration and advisory investigation — October 24, 2026

Scott authorized [PR265](https://github.com/scottconverse/civiccast-native/pull/265)
and merge after applicable CI passes, followed by a Brotli investigation/report.
No installer rebuild or new release is authorized. At preparation of this update,
integration awaits corrected-head CI; PR265 records the subsequent merge result.
Do not infer repository-wide green CI from a merge: informational scans have findings.

- Initial PR head: `50b4e11d15f36aa50ba2bf02f9bd417d1e1ddf60`.
  Windows closure/native job `121056228553` passed in run `40155601318`.
  App-payload reproducibility run `40155601291` passed byte equality.
- Informational randomized run `40155601353` exposed five deterministic stale
  policy/doc assertions (seed `824704267`): native collection counts/floors,
  removed historical coder-seat wording, and two old landing-page assumptions.
  All five reproduced locally. The still-running unit workflow `40155601318`
  was cancelled before pushing corrections; cancelled is not passed.
- The integration correction updates collection expectations to 2082 pure /
  2324 total / 2321 Windows non-integration tests, and raises JUnit floors to
  2032 / 2271, preserving the existing 50-test margin. Role checks protect
  current owner assignment; landing-page checks protect current release links,
  reject withdrawn releases, retain prohibited-claim checks and require historical
  citations if historical measurements return. Product/page content is unchanged.
- Reuse the passed payload byte-equality proof for these test/doc/floor-only
  corrections; they do not alter packaging. Await applicable CI on the corrected
  PR head, including the downstream claims-evidence verifier, before merging.
  Main rules require a PR but returned no named required checks or approving
  review requirement. The security workflow and randomized suite are explicitly
  non-required/informational; report their findings without making them new gates.
- Focused local verification passed: 50 documentation/role tests and 21 native
  workflow-policy tests (including live collection/floor checks), plus ruff lint,
  formatting and git diff --check. The checker code remains unchanged; reuse its
  153-test evidence and the hosted Windows proof above.
- Previous local watchers ended. Next action at preparation: push the corrected
  head, wait for applicable CI, and merge the exact authorized candidate.

Brotli findings (dependency correction is not implemented):

- PYSEC-2026-4322 / CVE-2026-111497 / GHSA-9v8h-qqgm-4m35 is one upstream
  decoder memory-corruption issue, rated critical (CVSS 4.0 9.2), fixed in 1.2.1.
  See [PyPA advisory](https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/blob/main/vulns/brotli/PYSEC-2026-4322.yaml)
  and [upstream fix release](https://github.com/google/brotli/releases/tag/v1.2.1).
- Optional `agenda-js-import` -> crawl4ai 0.9.2 (`brotli>=1.1.0`) locks 1.2.0.
  Installing that extra enables HTTPX's Brotli decoder automatically. CivicCast's
  `js_portal` robots.txt fetch provides a concrete remote-response input path.
  This is static reachability evidence, not an executed exploit or compromise.
- Fix needed: require `brotli>=1.2.1` in that optional extra and refresh only its
  affected lock/hashes; verify the selected version, advisory result and focused
  agenda/HTTP tests. Crawl4ai 0.9.2 accepts 1.2.1, and a Python 3.12 Windows x64
  wheel exists. Installed affected environments also need their decoder updated
  and processes restarted. Do not add an allowlist waiver.
- Exact released source `2e19612467fda894d63e499580e4d7b5f029f5f2` excludes Brotli
  and crawl4ai from the native Python locks; packaging uses `--no-deps`.
  Bounded HTTP ranges inspected the published app pack's ZIP directory:
  1,152,522 bytes read, 9963 entries / 83 wheels, no Brotli/crawl4ai paths.
  Full artifact checksum/signature verification and installed-environment
  inspection were not performed; other embedded decoders are not ruled out.
- Security run `40155601323` also reports filelock, pypdf, setuptools, virtualenv,
  Zod, Vitest/mocker and Undici findings. Their reachability and artifact scope
  were not investigated here. No dependency edits, waiver, installer rebuild,
  release or LFS transfer was performed.

### Claims-binding follow-up during integration

Corrected head `8b3c90174aa584238e6ccc8aa9f58ab895502913` passed its Windows
job in run `40158115701`. Its unit job reported 16 failures / 11712 passes:
all failures derived from six workflow blob bindings left stale by the JUnit
floor correction. Local checks reproduced those six mismatches. The downstream
claims verifier rejected the failed producer; this is not green CI.

The six registry workflow references are renewed after reviewing the floor/comment
only delta; see the October 24 section of the existing current-source review
note. No producer, registered node, control or enforcement is weakened, and no
historical acceptance is renewed. All 125 claims-evidence policy tests passed locally after rebinding (67.49s).
The next candidate must complete same-run CI.
The previous finite merge watcher exited on these required failures without
merging. No merge is currently armed while this follow-up is prepared.


### October 27, 2026 -- October 26 station black/silent outage: proven cause, correction

Working branch `fix/black-silent-20261027` from current tree (head `677d800f`, merge
`69c2bcae`). Nothing committed, pushed or merged; no installer rebuild, no service
configuration change, no station interruption.

Observed cause (log, not inference). Retained control-plane log
`C:\ProgramData\CivicCast\logs\control_plane-app.log.6` (now `.4`) line 5832-5859:

- `2026-10-25 07:49:55,675` content-reload *source preparation succeeded* (`took 5.4s
  for 1 segment(s)`). Only the dispatch step then failed: `07:49:55,679 ERROR
  civiccast.egress.daemon: Content-reload dispatch failed for public; restarting
  encoder.` followed by
  `FileNotFoundError: [WinError 206] The filename or extension is too long:
  'C:\Program Files\CivicCast (Native)\runtime\dependencies\gstreamer\bin'`
  raised from `gstreamer_runtime.py:137 _DLL_HANDLES.append(os.add_dll_directory(bin_dir))`,
  reached via `daemon.py:6045 _reload_steps` -> `strategy.py:1538 reload_content` ->
  `strategy.py:1253 _resolve_encoder_override` -> `encoder_probe.py:140/57/30/43`.
- The named path exists and is 70 characters long, so this was NOT a missing path or
  an over-long name. `os.add_dll_directory` appends to a process-wide loader search
  path whose buffer is a fixed 32,767 characters; `bootstrap_installed_gstreamer_runtime`
  had no per-directory guard and is re-entered by every reload encoder probe, so the
  buffer was exhausted. Reproduced on this host with the installed bin directory in a
  fresh CPython 3.12 process: 460 registrations succeed, the next raises exactly this
  exception and every later call fails permanently.
- That single process-wide counter explains the otherwise puzzling evidence: three
  independent channels all went TRANSITIONING within ~21s of one another (public
  07:49:55.724, education 07:50:16.9xx) and never returned to ON_AIR, while 171
  dispatch errors (57/channel) and 168 transition-stall errors accumulated over the
  following 26h. Worker PIDs never changed, and the retained worker tails show the
  mux still encoding (26247449 buffers, +26247444 since PLAYING) with
  `chain-in 5.0s: in video=+0 audio=+0` -- zero source-chain input into the selector
  while 150 video / 234 audio buffers per 5s of black/silent filler reached the mux.
- Failed recovery has the same cause, not a second one: `_request_reload` catches the
  exception, logs "restarting encoder" and returns False, which arms a `_pending_reloads`
  pin (wait for worker plan EOS). Recovery then re-enters the SAME probe -- both the
  reload-stall watchdog re-issue and the restart's `strategy.start()` path call
  `_resolve_encoder_override` -- so every retry raised the same WinError 206 in that
  process. Nothing but a process restart could have cleared it. This is distinct from
  the historical filesrc11 CI failure and from the HLS relay log-cap warnings.

Correction (smallest sufficient behavior): `bootstrap_installed_gstreamer_runtime` now
records each registered directory (normcase key) in `_REGISTERED_DLL_DIRECTORIES` and
calls `os.add_dll_directory` at most once per directory per process, appending the
handle (keeping it referenced) only after a successful call. This mirrors the existing
`civiccast.captions.runtime._CUDA_DLL_DIRECTORY_HANDLES` pattern. The unguarded call
also exists in installed `2e196124` and in the signed `42339334` build, so the running
station is expected to hit the same wall ~460 reload probes after each control-plane
start unless this is delivered.

Focused red/green (same scenarios, same runtime, retained receipts in
`.agent-runs/black-silent-20261027/`):

- RED, production-exact: installed `runtime\python.exe` + installed `civiccast`
  2e196124 running the probe loop -> `RESULT probe #460 raised` with the byte-identical
  06:49 traceback lines and WinError 206. GREEN, fixed repo source on the same
  interpreter/runtime -> `RESULT all 600 probes succeeded`, one loader directory.
- `tests/native/test_gstreamer_runtime.py` adds
  `test_repeated_reload_probes_register_the_dll_directory_only_once` (deterministic
  loader-budget stub) and `test_real_loader_survives_repeated_reload_probes` (real
  loader, 600 probes). Both FAIL before the correction with the production exception
  and pass after (`2 failed` -> `32 passed` with the encoder-probe/decision tests).
- Actual native A/V after the previously fatal count: one process performs 600 real
  `probe_hardware_encoder` calls, then runs a real production-shape worker with a real
  content reload; `CTRL reload committed` is present, and the emitted 640x360 h264 +
  AAC 48k stereo TS decodes to mean RGB (249,0,3) solid red program (ffmpeg
  blackdetect reports no black segment) with mean_volume -20.0 dB, max -1.3 dB.

Limits: this proves the mechanism, the correction and the reload A/V path; it does not
prove that a ~95h soak now stays clean, and no new installer was built, so the
installed station still carries the unguarded call. Remaining executable action: root
review of the bounded diff, then commit/PR and a delivered build if the station is to
carry the fix.
