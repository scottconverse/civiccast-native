# Windows setup: station activation and self-test (exit 123; NSIS details list and dialogs)

Paths relative to `civiccast/apps/installer/src-tauri/`. Hooks = `nsis-hooks-bootstrap.nsh`.

## Development update - 2026-10-04

The step-67 dialog now names disk space, extraction, missing files and self-test
as possible causes. It directs operators to copy the setup details list before
closing and distinguishes it from the step-only installer log. This addresses
the misleading copy in HELP-87/88 and the step-67 part of NEW-1, without adding
persisted child-output capture or distinct exit codes. The inventory below is
the original beta.10 review; other proposed changes remain unimplemented here.
Installed-dialog verification remains pending.

## Where the text lives now
The hook step is Hooks:1393-1505 (strings listed below). The child program's own messages come from `src/native_activation.rs:841-880` (disk space), `src/main.rs:4742-4777` (AI self-test), `main.rs:5578, 5658` (runtime program self-test) and `main.rs:5915-5930` (exit 67 for every error after the packs verified). Those child messages appear only in the details list, because the step runs under `nsExec::ExecToLog` (Hooks:1459, 1467); the log file receives only "step d4-activate-station: returned N" (Hooks:1475).

## Current text
| String | Where | Source line |

| Dialog: "CivicCast (Native) setup could not activate the station: no signed station index (station-index.json) was found beside setup.exe at <folder>\station, and this setup.exe does not carry the embedded copy it normally ships with. Download the CivicCast (Native) setup again from the official release page, or copy the full CivicCast kit folder (setup.exe together with its station folder) onto this machine and run setup from there. See the installer log above for details." | Exit 123 | Hooks:1473 |
| "CivicCast (Native): station activation complete (or already activated; no-op)." | List, success | Hooks:1488 |
| "CivicCast (Native): station activation self-test FAILED (exit 67) — see the installer log above." | List | Hooks:1490 |
| Dialog: "CivicCast (Native) setup laid down the station's components, but the station's own self-test did not pass, so setup stopped rather than leave you with a station that looks installed and does not work. This is NOT a missing-files problem -- the component packs were obtained and verified. The self-test that failed is named in the installer log at C:\ProgramData\CivicCast\install-progress.log. Your recordings, database and settings in C:\ProgramData\CivicCast were not deleted." | Exit 123, child 67 | Hooks:1491 |
| Dialog: "CivicCast (Native) setup could not obtain the station's component packs from the signed station index it found. If you installed from a CivicCast kit folder, make sure its station folder was copied across whole. If you ran setup.exe on its own, the packs it needs must already be in this machine's pack cache from a previous install. See the installer log above for the exact underlying error -- it names either the missing pack or the signature/version check that refused one." | Exit 123, child 66 | Hooks:1494 (list line 1493) |
| Dialog: "This copy of CivicCast (Native) setup is not a valid release build: its embedded signing key was refused. Nothing is wrong with this machine.

| "Not enough free disk space to activate this station. The station's components need about N GB, plus 2 GB of working room, on the drive holding <install folder> -- but only M GB is free. Nothing has been changed or deleted. Free up space (or install to a drive that has it) and run setup again." | Details list (child text) | `native_activation.rs:870-879` |

## What really happens
Activation takes the signed station index (from the kit's `station` folder if present, otherwise the small copy inside `setup.exe`) and the model packs beside it or in the pack cache from an earlier install, with no network use (Hooks:1414-1473). It checks every signature, needs the total pack size plus 2 GB free (it proceeds if free space cannot be read), clears old extracted folders, extracts the speech and AI models, and runs a self-test on the station's own programs before it writes `station-set.json` and `activation-self-test.json` (manual ch. 10; `native_activation.rs:841-880`). The self-test runs the bundled programs (Python, the database tools, ffmpeg, the AI engine) once each, a short speech recording on the processor (limit 300 seconds) and the three AI models through a private AI engine (ready within 300 seconds, each answer up to 300 seconds; `main.rs:4782-4796`). Any failure ends setup with exit 123; the child's own code (66, 67, 78, 64/65) is the only thing that tells the causes apart, and it is in the log line "step d4-activate-station: returned N" (Hooks:1475). Code 67 is used for every error after the packs verified: full disk, failed extraction, missing file, or a failed self-test (`main.rs:5927-5929`).

## Mismatches
| ID | What it says | What really happens | Severity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| HELP-87 | "The self-test that failed is named in the installer log at ...install-progress.log" (Hooks:1491) | The log has no such line (Hooks:1475; contrast Hooks:861). The failing check is named only in the details list | SERIOUS |
| HELP-88 | "This is NOT a missing-files problem ... the self-test did not pass" | Code 67 also means no free space or a failed extraction (`native_activation.rs:870-879,947`; `main.rs:5927`). A reader with a full drive is told the wrong thing | SERIOUS |
| HELP-89 | One line "(K1)" for what can be many minutes | "K1" is an internal ticket id; no warning that extraction and AI test runs are long and quiet | Moderate |
| HELP-90 | "copy the full CivicCast kit folder (setup.exe together with its station folder)" | Nothing in setup says what the kit holds (`packs\` and `station\`, manual ch. 10). The kit is also not downloadable from the release page | Moderate |
| HELP-91 | "self-test" | Not explained: what is run, that it uses the processor (slow PCs need longer), that the Spanish translation is exercised | Moderate |
| NEW-1 | "see the installer log above" (Hooks:1490, 1493, 1503) next to dialogs saying "installer log at ...install-progress.log" | Two different things share one word: "above" is the details list in this window; the dialog text means the file. The file lacks the reason | Moderate |

## Proposed text
Details-list lines (now), replacing Hooks:1454: "Setting up the station: extracting the speech and AI files and running a self-test of the video tools, database tools, speech engine and AI models. This can take many minutes with little change on screen. Do not close setup." Failure pane lines: replace "see the installer log above" with "the reason is in the lines just above this one in this list".

Dialog 123 / code 67. Honest text for now (keep the words "self-test" and "installer log"):
> Setup error 123 (step code 67). Setup copied the station's files but stopped because the station's own self-test step did not finish, so you are not left with a station that looks installed and does not work. Code 67 covers: the drive ran out of room, a file could not be extracted or is missing, or the self-test failed. The self-test runs the video tools, database tools, speech engine and three AI models on this computer's processor. The exact reason is in the setup window's details list only: before closing, right-click inside it, choose Copy Details To Clipboard, and keep the text. The installer log (C:\ProgramData\CivicCast\install-progress.log) records only that step 67 failed. If the reason is free space, free some (plan for about 55 GB) and run setup again; setup rebuilds the files. Recordings, database and settings in C:\ProgramData\CivicCast were not deleted. Help: https://github.com/scottconverse/civiccast-native/issues

After fix (distinct codes and the child's text copied into the log): "Setup error 123 (self-test). The station's self-test failed at: <first line of the failing check>. ..." and a separate "Setup error 123 (disk space). Setup needs about N GB free on <drive> and M GB is free. Free space and run setup again."

Dialog 123 / code 66 (replace Hooks:1494): "Setup error 123 (step code 66). Setup could not get the station's speech and AI model packs, or one of them failed its signature check. If you installed from a kit, copy the kit's whole 'station' folder beside setup.exe and run setup again. A first install cannot use setup.exe on its own: the packs would have to be in this computer's pack cache from an earlier install, and uninstalling deletes that cache. The details list names the pack or check that failed. The installer log (C:\ProgramData\CivicCast\install-progress.log) records only that step 66 failed. Help line."

No-index dialog (replace Hooks:1473): "Setup error 123 (no station index). Setup could not find the station's signed index file (station-index.json) in <folder>\station, and this setup.exe does not contain its built-in copy. Download setup.exe again from the official release page, or copy the full CivicCast kit folder (setup.exe together with its 'packs' and 'station' folders) onto this computer and run setup from there. The installer log (C:\ProgramData\CivicCast\install-progress.log) shows the folder setup looked in."

Codes 78 and 64/65: keep the existing text and add "Setup error 123 (step code 78)." at the front (and for 64/65) and the help line. Other codes: add "Setup error 123 (step code N)." at the front and "The details list in this window shows the exact reason; copy it before closing." before the existing last sentence.

## Notes for the coder
- The "Setup error N." prefix written at the front of the proposed dialogs is added once by `CIVICCAST_FAIL` (Hooks:420; see `installer-failures-and-logs`). It is shown here so each text reads in full; do not paste it into each string as well. Budget: `NSIS_MAX_STRLEN` is 1,024 and the log wrapper adds about 31 characters, so each edited string (without the prefix) must stay under about 950 characters. Longest proposed text in this file is under that budget unless a note below says otherwise.
- Edit Hooks:1454, 1458, 1466, 1472, 1473, 1490, 1491, 1493, 1494, 1496, 1497, 1500, 1501, 1503, 1504. Add the "Setup error N" prefix once in `CIVICCAST_FAIL` (Hooks:420) rather than per string.
- Test pins, `tests/installer/test_nsis_bootstrap_hooks.py`: line 851 (every activation dialog must contain "installer log"; the no-index text must contain "release page" and "kit"); line 1392 (67 arm must contain "self-test" and must not contain "pack cache"; code 78 arm must contain "not a valid release build" and "Nothing is wrong with this machine"). The proposed 66 text may use "pack cache" only in the 66 arm. Keep dialogs under about 990 characters.
- Needs a code fix, not text: capture the child's output so `install-progress.log` contains the real reason (switch `ExecToLog` at Hooks:1459, 1467 to a captured form like Hooks:852, then log `$1` as Hooks:861 does); return distinct child codes for disk space, extraction and self-test (`main.rs:5927-5929`, `native_activation.rs:870-879`); print progress during extraction (HELP-89).
- UNVERIFIED: how long the self-test takes on a PC with no graphics card (manual ch. 10); that stderr is not also copied to the log by NSIS (confirm with a failing run).
- No language-file changes.
