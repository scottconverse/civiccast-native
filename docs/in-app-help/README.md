# Historical in-app help audit: beta.10 snapshot

This is the archived documentation-sprint index from 2026-10-03. It describes beta.10 screens and proposed copy from before the Beta.11 audit. The 62 linked per-screen audit files are retained for traceability and each is marked as a historical snapshot. Do not apply their proposed strings as current guidance. The separate Beta.11 source inventory and its reconciled findings are in [help.md](help.md).

## How to use these files

The tables below are the historical beta.10 audit index, not a current implementation checklist. Their mismatch counts, source lines, and proposed copy record what that audit found at the time. Nothing in those archived tables establishes later behavior; use [help.md](help.md) for the dated source-audit scope and findings.

## Code fixes found while writing the help (not text work)

These came from the manual writers, the fact-checkers and the help-file writers. Each is a product defect or gap, with the manual chapter or help file that describes it.

| Area | Problem | Where documented |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Summary review | Corrected in beta.12 source: approval uses the reviewed draft fingerprint; approved summaries remain available for signed-record export and history. Package checks are recorded with the matching release | `summary.md`, manual ch. 5 |
| Contributors | Send to schedule likely fails for any submission with a requested air date (no time zone on the producer's date); producers never see operator notes | `contribute.md`, manual ch. 3 |
| Program Guide | Skipped airings are never retried by Refresh guide; the Channel schedule page lists unpublished airings | `guide.md`, manual ch. 3 |
| Auto-schedule | The screen says items need an operator commit; they are created Published and compiled hourly | `autoschedule.md`, manual ch. 3 |
| Alerts | Destinations are empty by default and cannot be attached to a rule; several alert kinds (including emergency-alert source down) have no rule | `alerts.md`, manual ch. 8 |
| Emergency alerts | Polling and auto-surface are off unless CIVICCAST_EAS and CIVICCAST_EAS_AUTO_SURFACE are set and nothing sets them; the portal's emergency box shows a hard-coded placeholder | `eas.md`, `public-shell.md`, manual ch. 8 |
| Paywall | Saving with the signing-secret box blank erases the stored secret; no tiers or checkout routes; no sign-in email is sent | `paywall.md`, `public-paywall.md`, manual ch. 6 |
| Resident subscribe | Notices are never sent; the confirmation link is a bare path with no web address and no page serving it; RSS feeds are empty | `public-subscribe.md`, manual ch. 6 |
| Playback policy | Most settings are not enforced on video | `playback.md`, manual ch. 6 |
| Analytics | The "Telemetry is off" box points to a Reports tab and a Setup switch that do not exist | `analytics.md`, manual ch. 7 |
| Live and Channels | The sample test source passes pre-flight from a file with no camera; Take live with a source last checked more than 30 seconds ago is refused before it re-checks | `live.md`, `channels.md`, manual ch. 4 |
| Facility | Sample data only; no way to send a command | `facility.md`, manual ch. 4 |
| Sign-in page | The only sign-in is on a page titled First setup | `_shell-signin-and-session.md`, manual ch. 2 |
| Installer | The setup page and first-run wizard promise AI models download after setup; setup needs the full kit and stops with exit 110 or 123 without it | `installer-nsis-setup-wizard.md`, `installer-gui-download-plan.md`, manual ch. 10 |
| Installer | The exit 128 and 129 dialogs say nothing was changed; setup has already stopped the service and replaced the program files | `installer-nsis-upgrade-database.md`, manual ch. 10 |
| Installer | The self-test failure dialog says the failing test is named in the installer log; it is not | `installer-nsis-activation-selftest.md`, manual ch. 10 |
| Installer | Uninstall deletes the model-pack cache (about 21 GB) that a reinstall cannot re-download (MA-17) | `installer-uninstall.md`, manual ch. 10 |
| Backup and restore | No `civiccast backup` or `restore` command exists; the DR drill calls the Postgres tools by bare name and most likely fails on native Windows | manual ch. 12 |
| Service configuration | No installer code writes the service `Environment` registry value that the manual's environment-variable recipe relies on | manual ch. 11 and 12 |
| Control Room | The sidecar service has no installer; the effect of Mute, Drop and Close room on a guest's sound was not found in code | manual ch. 4 and 11 |
| Logs | Corrected in beta.12 source: raw control-plane and PostgreSQL logs rotate; old oversized copies age out through rotation. Support-bundle coverage remains a separate limitation | manual ch. 12 and 14 |
| Health | `/health` shows `degraded` only for a non-current database schema | manual ch. 14 |
| Live CDN publisher | `civiccast/live/cdn_publisher.py` is not covered in the architecture; unclear whether it is wired into the shipped app | manual ch. 16 |
| In-app manual | `civiccast/docsite/manual.json` is generated from `docs/USER-MANUAL.md` and must be regenerated; the generator keeps only about 2.8% of the new manual's text, 50 screenshots are missing, and internal links may land on Page not found | `help.md` |
| Captions | Live caption audio is dropped when the caption worker falls behind (the top open engine item) | manual Appendix H |
