# Cross-Platform Installer

CivicCast exposes guided installer contracts for Linux, macOS, and two
distinct Windows product lines. The current public Windows beta is the WSL
line: its host bootstrapper prepares Ubuntu on WSL2 and its CivicCast services
run inside that Ubuntu runtime with systemd. The native Windows line is in
development under ADR 0021 and uses a separate product identity and a
session-0 Windows service. The two Windows products share a codebase but do
not install, repair, or remove each other's runtime.

## Platform Matrix

| Platform | Runtime | Package/bootstrap | Service manager | Readiness rule |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Linux | Native Linux | `.deb` or `.rpm` | systemd | Ready only when service metadata and package proof are present. |
| macOS | Native macOS operator host | `.pkg` | launchd | Ready only when `.pkg` metadata and launchd bootstrap proof are present. |
| Windows 11 - WSL line (current public beta) | Ubuntu on WSL2 | Tauri/NSIS setup app plus WSL2 bootstrap manifest | systemd inside WSL2 | Ready only when the setup app builds, WSL2 Ubuntu exists, and the guided WSL lanes pass. |
| Windows 11 - native line (in development) | Native Windows | Distinct Tauri/NSIS setup app and native payload | session-0 Windows service | Readiness is governed by ADR 0021 and `.agent-runs/native-windows/specs/spec-installer-lifecycle.md`; development evidence is not a public native-beta claim. |

## Windows Setup App

This section describes the current public WSL-line setup app. Its Windows
operator entry point is the Tauri setup executable built from
`civiccast/apps/installer` with `npm run tauri:build`. The setup app gives the
operator a guided readiness walkthrough, while CivicCast services still run
inside WSL2 Ubuntu per ADR 0003. ADR 0021 governs the separate native Windows
product and its installer lifecycle. A valid WSL-line release artifact must be copied from
Tauri's NSIS bundle output and hashed by `scripts/build_release_artifacts.py
--windows-installer`; placeholder bytes or a bootstrap manifest alone do not
satisfy the Windows double-click installer lane.

When WSL2 Ubuntu is missing, the setup app must offer `Install WSL2 Ubuntu` and
launch the Microsoft WSL installer with Windows elevation. It must not leave a
non-technical beta tester at a bare terminal command as the only path forward.

## Artifact Verification

Every install artifact must have:

1. Real SHA-256 computed from the artifact bytes.
2. A `.sidecar.json` file with the same SHA-256.
3. A signed install manifest.
4. Service and bootstrap metadata.
5. For a Windows `.exe` whose install manifest claims `signed: true`, a
   genuinely embedded Authenticode certificate table (Azure Trusted Signing;
   see [CODE_SIGNING_POLICY.md](../../CODE_SIGNING_POLICY.md)). This release
   chain carries no Sigstore/cosign step, so no artifact is required to carry
   a `.sigstore.json` bundle.

Missing artifacts, hash mismatches, missing sidecars, unsigned manifests, and
a `signed: true` claim with no real Authenticode evidence are blocked states.
Operators should download the artifact and sidecar together, or rebuild the
package and rerun verification rather than bypass the proof.

Windows operators should verify the setup `.exe` before running it. The
operator-facing checklist lives in
[Windows Release Trust And Verification](../install/windows-release-trust.md)
and explains the difference between SHA-256 checksums, sidecars, and
Authenticode signing.

## Durable Storage Prerequisite

Every operator or beta-test install needs durable storage before staff
workflows are used. If `DATABASE_URL` is unset, CivicCast creates a local
durable SQLite database, applies the Alembic migration graph, and reports the
storage lane ready before first-admin setup. Technical admins can set
`DATABASE_URL` to use Postgres instead.

If `CIVICCAST_ALLOW_EPHEMERAL_STORES=1` is set, CivicCast can run lightweight
development and UI checks with in-memory stores, but staff writes are lost on
restart. That is not a beta-ready operator posture.

## Ollama Runtime Provisioning (Windows)

The Windows WSL2 bootstrap provisions the local Ollama AI runtime as part of
the guided setup, inside the same charter walls as the rest of the runtime
install: it detects and reuses a healthy existing Ollama install first, and
only installs a pinned version (sha-verified, standard `/usr/local` location,
no CivicCast-owned parallel install tree) when Ollama is genuinely absent from
the WSL distro. A present-but-unhealthy install is left untouched and refused,
never forced. Model provisioning (the standard summary and
translation tags -- a fixed three-tag set on every install, sourced from the same catalog the Setup wizard's own model
download uses) runs strictly after the operator console is already reachable,
so a slow or failed model pull never blocks or delays dashboard access; a
failure surfaces as an honest message on the existing runtime-readiness lane
rather than reverting the install to an error state. This is designed
behavior proven against real bash execution with faked tooling in this
repository's test suite; a real end-to-end run against the real ollama.com
archive and a real model pull on a clean machine is separately the VM
gauntlet's job.

## Model Setup

The installer reports model setup as planned, running, progress, complete, cancelled, skipped, unavailable, or blocked. Only hash-verified online downloads or offline bundle imports may report complete proof. Skipped and unavailable models must show `proof_unavailable` and tell the operator to rerun setup or import the offline bundle.

## Air-Gapped Import

Air-gapped imports require offline mode, an operator guide, proof metadata, and real hashes for every artifact in the bundle. If network access is enabled, proof metadata is missing, a file is absent, or a hash mismatches, the import is blocked with the exact file and next operator action.

External provider lanes such as Internet Archive remain credential-gated. Air-gapped proof does not claim those online integrations are verified.

## Beta Tester Handoff

For v1.2 beta testers, the installer summary is paired with
`civiccast installer beta-handoff --json`. That handoff summary adds the
release artifact acquisition manifest, clean Windows install proof evidence,
durable storage setup, dependency/model gates, NATS, mTLS, and external
provider credentials to the same fail-closed operator view. The detailed tester path lives in
[Beta Tester Handoff](beta-tester-handoff.md).
