"""Trusted-proxy / X-Forwarded-For resolution for CDN-fronted deployments.

When CivicCast sits behind a CDN (BunnyCDN, Cloudflare, etc.) every request
arrives with ``request.client.host == <cdn edge IP>``. The paywall rate
limiter, the recording cross-station guard, the audit logger, the analytics
trusted-proxy filter, and any other "real client IP" consumer must walk the
``X-Forwarded-For`` chain back to a non-trusted hop — that hop is the real
client. Trusting the chain when the immediate peer is NOT a configured
trusted proxy is the well-known IP-spoof attack; trusting blindly when the
peer IS a trusted proxy is the only way to make CDN deployments work.

This module is the single canonical resolver. Callers wire it in via
``resolve_client_ip(request)`` instead of dipping into ``request.client.host``
or building their own parser.

## Configuration

Three env vars + one provider preset:

* ``CIVICCAST_TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS`` — comma-separated CIDR list. Wins over
  every other source. Use this when the operator has explicit knowledge
  of the proxy fleet (e.g. an internal load balancer subnet).
* ``CIVICCAST_CDN_PROVIDER`` (already used by ``civiccast.stream.cdn``) —
  when set to ``bunny`` or ``cloudflare_r2`` (or ``cloudflare``), the
  resolver UNIONS the provider's published edge CIDR list with the
  explicit ``CIVICCAST_TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS`` value. The published list is
  a snapshot in ``_PROVIDER_CIDR_PRESETS`` below; operators with a
  patched provider deployment can override with the explicit env var.
* ``CIVICCAST_TRUST_PRIVATE_PROXIES`` (``false`` by default) — whether
  RFC1918 / loopback / link-local hops are considered trusted. QA-4:
  defaulting this on let a same-peer caller pick its own rate-limit bucket
  by sending an arbitrary ``X-Forwarded-For`` value from loopback/RFC1918,
  since every such peer was implicitly trusted with nothing configured.
  Default is now OFF. Deployments that genuinely run "uvicorn behind
  nginx" on ``127.0.0.1`` (or any other private-address reverse proxy)
  MUST opt in explicitly by setting ``CIVICCAST_TRUST_PRIVATE_PROXIES=true``
  (or by configuring ``CIVICCAST_TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDRS`` with the proxy's
  real address) — otherwise X-Forwarded-For is ignored and the proxy's own
  peer IP is used, which is safe but breaks real-client-IP attribution
  behind that proxy.

The provider preset CIDR snapshots are intentionally LOW-PRECISION — they
cover the publicly documented edge networks at the time the snapshot was
taken (BunnyCDN's ``edge.bunnycdn.com`` netblocks, Cloudflare's published
``cloudflare.com/ips-v4`` + ``ips-v6`` listing). Operators should validate
the snapshots against the CDN provider's CURRENT documentation before
shipping to production. The lab/dev path defaults to no CDN and no trusted
private proxies — every IP is treated as an untrusted direct peer unless a
CDN provider or explicit CIDR/private-proxy opt-in is configured.
