"""Hard-coded model catalog (S13, decision A).

CivicCast does not fetch the model list from a provider API (decision A: hard-coded).
This module is the single source of truth for the §3.1.1 ``key -> model_id (runtime
tag) -> provider`` mapping plus the cost / latency / privacy / network flags that the
operator console renders and the service enforces.

The DEFAULT for every feature is the LOCAL (zero cloud fee, on-device, private) tier.
Summary's default is adaptive (12B QAT when a real GPU is present AND RAM >=16GB;
e4b otherwise, including every CPU-only box regardless of RAM -- see
``detect_summary_model_default``, which field evidence on a 32GB CPU-only reference
station retired the old RAM-only rule for: 12B took 366s+ to complete a summary there
and then failed twice more under realistic memory pressure, while e4b completed every
attempt in 94-128s). The CLOUD tiers (Ollama Cloud ``gemma4:31b-cloud`` + the
OpenRouter mid-tier) ship FUNCTIONAL (D13): they appear as real, selectable options,
are priced per token, require network, and are off until the operator selects one and
accepts the cost — they are not stubs.

Latency figures below (``latency_p95_ms``) are measured, not estimated, for every
on-box (``ollama``/``external``) tier that has been benchmarked on the CPU-only 32GB
reference station -- see each tier's ``notes`` for the measurement. The operator
console (``tierLatencyLabel`` in ``apps/portal-operator/src/screens/ai-models-format
.ts``) renders local CPU-bound tiers as a range with the CPU-only caveat rather than a
single misleadingly-precise number, because real CPU inference latency varies heavily
with transcript/recording length and concurrent load on the box -- a single p95
number was previously wrong by ~30x for summary and ~70x for captions on real
hardware. Cloud/frontier tiers keep a plain single-number label; their latency is
network-bound, not CPU-bound, and does not have that same variance.
