"""Control-plane-owned containment for the control plane's long-lived children.

THE DEFECT (OBSERVED, station, 2026-09-25, ``supervisor.log`` 07:20:32 -
07:32:15). The supervisor killed an unready control plane; the three HLS relay
ffmpegs that control plane had spawned SURVIVED as orphans holding the relays'
UDP ports. Every supervised relay after that failed at once with ``[udp @ ...]
bind failed: Error number -10048`` and retried on a 60 s backoff, so all three
channels stayed off air until the orphans were killed by hand (spawn=9, all
channels ok at 07:32:15 -- eleven minutes after the install).

WHY INHERITED MEMBERSHIP IN THE SUPERVISOR'S JOB IS NOT ENOUGH.
``civiccast.native.supervisor.job_object`` gives the supervisor a named job
with ``JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE`` and no breakaway, and children
inherit it -- that is spec D3's containment, and it is not what failed.
``KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE`` fires when the LAST HANDLE to the job closes, not when a
member process dies. The supervisor keeps its job handle open for its own
lifetime, so terminating one member (the control plane) reaps nothing: the
member's own children -- which inherited membership from it -- are left running
in a job whose handle is still held elsewhere. Measured on this box with real
processes (topology ``harness --job A--> middle --> grandchild``, 2026-09-25):

    middle relies on inherited membership in A only:
        TerminateProcess(middle) -> grandchild ALIVE at +2s; the grandchild
        only dies when job A's handle is closed.
    middle creates its own nested kill-on-close job B and self-assigns:
        TerminateProcess(middle) -> grandchild DEAD within 2s.

THE MECHANISM (what this module does). The control plane, at startup, creates
its own ANONYMOUS job with ``JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE`` and assigns
ITSELF to it. Nested jobs are supported on Windows 8+, so this composes with
the supervisor's job rather than fighting it: the control plane's job becomes
the innermost job of the tree, every process the control plane spawns inherits
it (no breakaway is requested anywhere in an ordinary spawn path), and because
the control plane holds the ONLY handle to that job, its death -- graceful
exit, crash, or ``TerminateProcess`` -- closes the last handle and the kernel
reaps the whole subtree. That is the same kernel behaviour the earlier
experiment measured, applied one level down.

WHY SELF-ASSIGNMENT RATHER THAN ASSIGNING EACH CHILD AT ITS SPAWN SITE. One
call covers every long-lived child the control plane will ever have, including
the ones it does not spawn directly: HLS relay ffmpegs
(``civiccast.stream._ffmpeg.start_ffmpeg``), the per-channel GStreamer playout
workers (``civiccast.egress.gst.strategy``), the TS/NDI/SDI relays
(``civiccast.egress.ts_relay`` / ``ndi_relay`` / ``sdi_relay``), contribution
coprocesses (``civiccast.live.contribution.coprocess``) and their own
grandchildren. Per-spawn-site assignment would have to be repeated at each of
those funnels and would silently miss the next one added.

WHY THE JOB IS ANONYMOUS (never named). Two control-plane processes can
overlap during a restart. A named job would let the second process's children
join the first process's job (and, worse, let either hold a handle that keeps
the other's kill-on-close from ever firing). An anonymous job is owned by
exactly one process and cannot be opened by anyone else.

WHY ``JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_BREAKAWAY_OK`` IS DELIBERATELY LEFT SET -- measured,
not assumed. ``civiccast.native.gstreamer_repair._detached_launch`` spawns the
installer's GStreamer re-stage with ``CREATE_BREAKAWAY_FROM_JOB`` FROM THE
CONTROL PLANE, because that repair stops the service and deletes the runtime
tree the control plane is running out of; it must outlive its parent. A
kill-on-close job that does not permit breakaway makes that ``CreateProcess``
fail outright, which would trade an orphan bug for a broken recovery tier.
Measured 2026-09-25 (three modes, real processes):

    control plane in the supervisor's job only (today's product):
        breakaway spawn ok
    control plane in its own job B WITHOUT breakaway allowed:
        PermissionError winerror=5 -- the repair launch fails
    control plane in its own job B WITH breakaway allowed:
        breakaway spawn ok (same as today)

Breakaway is not a hole in the containment: a child is only spared the job if
its ``CreateProcess`` explicitly asks for it, and the one call site that does
is documented to outlive the control plane. Ordinary spawns inherit the job.

FAILURE POSTURE. This never raises. A station whose containment could not be
established must still start and air -- that is the lesser evil -- but it is
not silent: the returned :class:`ContainmentStatus` carries the reason and the
caller logs it at ERROR, because the consequence is exactly the orphaned-relay
state this module exists to prevent.

This module is Windows-only by nature and imports pywin32 lazily inside
:class:`Win32ContainmentApi`'s methods, so importing it is harmless on any OS.
