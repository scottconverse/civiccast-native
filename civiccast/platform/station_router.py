"""FastAPI routes for S1 StationBoxProfile and the station identity profile.

Two distinct concerns, deliberately not conflated (S1 §2 "identity and
capability are deliberately separate concerns"):

* ``GET /api/staff/station-box-profile`` / ``/readiness`` — the S1
  ``StationBoxProfile`` capability report (computed, read-only).
* ``GET``/``PUT /api/staff/station/profile`` — the mutable operator
  identity profile (station name, timezone, storage roots, default
  channel) persisted in station-state, with the env-override precedence
  loader in ``civiccast.installer.station_state``.

Deviation from the S1 spec's literal path (documented, deliberate): S1 §4
writes the box-profile paths as ``/api/station-box-profile`` (no
``/api/staff`` prefix), by analogy with the existing public
``/api/hardware`` endpoint. That analogy does not hold here: the S1 spec
gates these routes to specific staff roles via ``require_any_role``, but
this codebase's staff bearer-token auth middleware
(``civiccast.auth.middleware.staff_auth_middleware``) only authenticates
requests whose path starts with ``/api/staff/`` — it is what populates
``request.state.operator_identity`` in the first place. A role-gated route
outside that prefix would never see an identity and would 401 for every
caller, including legitimately-scoped staff, which defeats the spec's
intent of "read-only diagnostic surfaces available to setup_admin /
meeting_operator / support_admin." Mounting under ``/api/staff/`` is the
functionally-correct choice; ``/api/hardware`` stays unprefixed because it
is genuinely public (no role gate at all).
