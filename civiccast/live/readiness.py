"""Observed readiness for a configured live source.

The defect this module exists to close (audit ENG-003): a
:class:`~civiccast.live.models.LiveSource` row counted as ``ready`` merely
because it existed. ``civiccast.live.relay._source_path`` stamped
``health_state=RELAY_HEALTH_READY`` on every configured row, and that health
value is the *only* gate
``civiccast.egress.live_takeover.build_live_takeover_source_plan`` applies
before a manual takeover changes what is on air. A camera that had been
unplugged for a week, or an address with a typo in it, was indistinguishable
from a live encoder right up to the moment air went black.

Readiness here is an *observation*, persisted on the row
(``probe_state`` / ``probe_observed_at`` / ``probe_detail`` /
``probe_error_code`` / ``probe_last_success_at``, migration
``0086_live_source_probe_state``) and aged against a TTL. Four states, and the
distinction between the last two is the whole point:

``never_probed``
    Nobody has looked. Not the same as broken, and not the same as ready.
``ready``
    A probe saw media within the TTL.
``stale``
    A probe saw media, but longer ago than the TTL. The last answer is not
    evidence about now.
``failed``
    The most recent probe did not see media.

Only ``ready`` may take over air. ``stale`` is re-probed at takeover time
rather than refused outright (that is the operator's realistic path: open Run
Meeting, see a five-minute-old observation, press Take), but the re-probe is
what decides -- the stale observation never is.
