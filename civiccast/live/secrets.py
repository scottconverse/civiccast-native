"""Keyring-backed live-source credentials (WP-07).

``live_sources.credentials_handle`` has existed since migration
``0007_live_sessions`` and, until this module, nothing anywhere in the product
read it back. ``civiccast.live.source_probe``'s docstring said so in as many
words: "No credential-resolution helper exists anywhere in this codebase yet
... nothing reads ``credentials_handle`` back out." An operator could type a
handle into Setup, the API would echo it back, and the station would then
probe and open the source with no credential at all.

This closes that. The pattern is the one the repository already uses for every
other secret it holds -- :mod:`civiccast.auth.keyring_store`,
:mod:`civiccast.control_room.secrets`, :mod:`civiccast.ai_models.secrets`: the
database stores only the opaque handle, the real secret lives in the OS
credential store under a namespace of its own, and it is resolved **at
execution time** by an injected :data:`SecretResolver` -- never at
configuration time, never at graph-build time, never into a row.

Only SRT carries a credential (see
``civiccast.live.source_endpoints.CREDENTIAL_SUPPORTED_SOURCE_TYPES`` for why
RTSP, RTMP, and NDI cannot). Its single secret value is the SRT passphrase.
