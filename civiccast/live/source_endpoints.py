"""One place that decides what endpoint shape each live source type accepts.

Before WP-07 the rule lived in exactly one caller --
``civiccast.installer.service._source_setup_endpoint``, which validates the
Setup wizard's ``kind`` (usb-hdmi / phone-app / encoder / ndi) rather than the
stored ``source_type``. The staff API's own
:class:`~civiccast.live.models.LiveSourceCreate` accepted ``HttpUrl | str`` and
checked only that ``source_type`` was one of the four literals, so
``POST /api/staff/live/sources`` happily stored ``source_type="srt"`` with an
``http://`` endpoint, an ``rtsp`` type pointed at an NDI name, or a URL with
``user:password@`` embedded in it. Nothing downstream re-checked: the probe's
``_build_probe_command`` fails closed on an unrecognized shape, but only after
the row had already been advertised to the operator as a configured source.

This module is the single rule. It is keyed on the persisted ``source_type``
(not on a wizard ``kind``) so create, update, and any future importer all get
the same answer, and it returns the *normalized* endpoint the store should
persist so two spellings of the same address cannot produce two different rows.

Credential capability is decided here too, because "which endpoint shapes are
legal" and "which of them may carry a credential handle" are the same question
asked twice -- see :data:`CREDENTIAL_SUPPORTED_SOURCE_TYPES` and
``docs/adr/0025-live-source-credential-capability.md``.

#: Source types whose authenticated shape CivicCast can actually execute
#: without exposing the secret.
#:
#: Only SRT qualifies. Its passphrase is a first-class option on both runtimes
#: this product drives -- FFmpeg's libsrt protocol option ``-passphrase`` and
#: GStreamer's ``srtsrc passphrase=`` property -- so the secret never has to be
#: interpolated into the endpoint URL that gets persisted, logged, returned in
#: an ingest plan, or written into proof output.
#:
#: RTSP and RTMP are deliberately excluded. Neither FFmpeg's RTSP demuxer nor
#: its RTMP protocol accepts a username/password anywhere except inside the
#: URL itself, so an authenticated RTSP/RTMP source could only be probed by
#: building ``rtsp://user:secret@host/...`` -- exactly the plaintext-in-a-URL
#: shape the station is forbidden to construct. (GStreamer's ``rtspsrc`` does
#: have ``user-id``/``user-pw`` properties, but a source CivicCast cannot
#: *probe* can never become observed-ready, so playout capability alone is not
#: enough.) NDI has no credential concept at all.
#:
#: Consequence, enforced in :func:`normalize_endpoint`'s caller and in the
#: operator UI: an rtsp/rtmp/ndi row may not carry a ``credentials_handle``,
#: and the UI's credential control for those types is disabled with the copy
#: in :data:`CREDENTIAL_UNSUPPORTED_REASON`.
