"""The CivicCast-side contract for the self-hosted VDO.Ninja instance (S17).

CivicCast never links any VDO.Ninja code into this Apache tree (VDO.Ninja is
AGPL-3.0, run UNMODIFIED as a separate process — S17 §7). Its only integration
surface is:

* **URL minting** — deterministic VDO.Ninja room/guest/view URLs built from the
  room's opaque ``vdo_room_name`` and a single-use invite token. No socket is
  opened to mint a URL; the actual WebRTC negotiation is VDO.Ninja's, browser-
  side, via its IFRAME API (postMessage) embedded in the operator console.
* **diagnostics** — TURN reachability + VDO/coturn co-process health, delegated
  to an injected probe (the S9 supervisor lands in slice 3d; until then the
  probe is unwired and reports honestly "unavailable", never a false "reachable").

This module defines the contract (``VdoNinjaBridge`` protocol + result/error
types), a fail-closed ``NullVdoNinjaBridge`` for when the tier is not configured,
and ``UrlVdoNinjaBridge`` — the real, deterministic URL builder. Tests inject a
fake implementing the protocol.

    ``turn_reachable`` is the load-bearing commissioning signal (a guest behind

    supervisor (slice 3d).

    ``turn_reachable`` reflects the most recent probe of ``turn_host``:
    ``turn_port`` regardless of ``coturn_process_up`` — the owner-approved
    "documented external TURN" posture (coturn has no native Windows build;
    see ``civiccast/installer/contribution_install.py``) means there is
    deliberately no LOCAL coturn process to supervise, but the configured
    external server's reachability is still the thing that matters to a
    guest behind NAT, and is still probed.

    TURN target (``CIVICCAST_TURN_HOST`` / ``CIVICCAST_TURN_PORT``, read at
