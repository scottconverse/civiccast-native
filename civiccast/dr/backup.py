"""Real backup: a physical database snapshot + a media manifest, not a proof token.

Two engines are supported, dispatched from ``DATABASE_URL``:

* **SQLite** (the default managed-storage deployment): the SQLite backup API
  (``sqlite3.Connection.backup``) produces a consistent point-in-time copy
  even while the source file is open elsewhere — never a raw
  ``shutil.copy2`` of a live db file, which can copy a half-written page.
* **Postgres** (the technical-deployment option): ``pg_dump`` in custom
  format via subprocess, driven off the parsed ``DATABASE_URL``.

Table row counts and content checksums are computed generically over
SQLAlchemy (:func:`snapshot_tables`) so the same code verifies both engines —
the restore drill re-runs the identical function against the restored copy.
