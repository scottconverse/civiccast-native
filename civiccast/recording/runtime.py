            # normal shutdown path (unlike POSIX SIGTERM, which ffmpeg traps
            # to flush + exit cleanly). Measured on this box: an 8s capture
            # at ~200kbps never crossed the first 256 KiB flush boundary, so
            # `stop()`/`finalize()` always produced a 0-byte file --
            # scheduled recording could not produce ANY asset shorter than
            # that boundary, and any recording lost its unflushed tail
            # regardless of length. `-flush_packets 1` makes the muxer write

            # Windows-abrupt kill loses at most the packet in flight instead
