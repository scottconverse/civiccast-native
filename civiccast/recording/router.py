"""S21 scheduled-recording API surface (slice 3).

One staff family over the ``RecordingStore`` + ``RecordingService`` DI
seams:

* **Staff CRUD** (``/api/staff/recording/schedules[/{id}]``,
  ``/schedules/{id}/record-now``, ``/jobs``, ``/jobs/{id}/stop``) —
  the spec §4 roles are ``setup_admin`` + ``meeting_operator`` for
  write; ``support_admin`` is added on read so support staff can audit
  the job table without being able to mutate it.

DI seams (``get_recording_store`` / ``get_recording_service``) return
``None`` at import so the module opens no database; the app factory
overrides them in ``_wire_durable_stores`` and wires the scheduled
capture/finalize/alert runtime. A missing service is a 503, never a
silent 200 against storage that is not there.
``x-required-roles`` is mirrored into the generated OpenAPI so the
published contract cannot drift from the runtime role gate (same
convention as S23 / S24 / S25 / S26).
