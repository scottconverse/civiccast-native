"""Durable store for recording schedules + jobs (S21 slice 1).

Per-request store over the single global session factory (same lazy posture
as eas / ai_models / metadata / reporting / underwriting / agenda / paywall).
All comparisons bind through parameters (no string interpolation) and ride
the indexes defined in migration ``0056_scheduled_recording``.

* ``upsert_schedule`` / ``get_schedule`` / ``list_schedules`` /
  ``delete_schedule`` — schedule CRUD; unique constraint on
  ``(station_id, name)`` so the operator UI's picker is unambiguous.
* ``create_job`` / ``get_job`` / ``list_jobs`` / ``set_job_state`` /
  ``find_overlapping_jobs`` — job CRUD + the hot-path "is another job
  already running on this input?" lookup (DC-5 overlap detection).
* ``reconcile_orphaned_active_jobs`` — startup hook that transitions any
  job stuck in ``recording``/``arming``/``finalizing`` past its
  window-end to ``failed`` with a reason. The "never a silent miss"
  invariant for crash-mid-record (spec §6 failure handling).
