"""S7 watch-folder poll daemon.

PR #19 built the ``WatchFolderConfig`` data model, CRUD API, and settings
UI (``civiccast/schedule/media_lifecycle_{models,store,router}.py`` +
migration ``0079_media_lifecycle``) but explicitly deferred the daemon that
actually polls a configured directory and ingests what it finds --
``docs/spec/3.0/sections/S7-media-lifecycle-and-readiness.md`` §6's
"watch-folder monitor (background daemon)" DONE criterion was unmet: no
file on disk listed ``monitor_path``, checked for write-completion, or
called into ingest. This module is that daemon.

Same env-gated settings-dataclass / ``run_once``/``run_forever`` /
``ThreadSupervisor`` shape as
:mod:`civiccast.schedule.media_lifecycle_worker`,
:mod:`civiccast.schedule.retention_worker`, and
:mod:`civiccast.schedule.media_integrity_worker` -- this codebase's
established pattern for "periodically scan and act." It never runs its own
ingest pipeline: every file it hands off goes through the SAME path as an
operator's manual upload (:meth:`civiccast.schedule.store.PostgresAssetStore.ingest_upload`,
mirroring ``civiccast.schedule.router.upload_asset``'s ffprobe -> validate
-> hash -> thumbnail -> persist sequence) or, for a file that changed after
already being ingested, the SAME replace-source path an operator uses
(:meth:`civiccast.schedule.media_lifecycle_store.MediaLifecycleStore.apply_replace_source`),
tagged ``source_kind="watch_folder"`` for provenance
(:data:`~civiccast.schedule.media_lifecycle_models.INGEST_SOURCE_WATCH_FOLDER`).

Design decisions the spec text itself does not resolve -- processed-file
disposition (move-to-subfolder vs. leave-with-ledger), degraded/unreachable
-path visibility, and the delete-safety posture -- are recorded in
``docs/adr/0024-watch-folder-daemon-processed-file-and-degraded-state.md``
rather than picked silently (CLAUDE.md "Open decisions" policy). The short
version: the source file is NEVER deleted by this daemon in either mode.

Concurrency shape (spec doesn't say; this is this build's resolution, also
in ADR 0024): per-folder work is fully serialized -- one config's files are
scanned and (if due) ingested one at a time, in listing order, inside a
single call to :meth:`WatchFolderWorker._scan_one_folder` -- while multiple
*different* configs' folders may be scanned concurrently, bounded by
``max_concurrent_folders`` (mirrors
``MediaLifecycleWorkerSettings.max_transcode_dispatch_per_pass``'s "batch
cap per pass" idiom, just applied to folders instead of transcode jobs).
Per-file work is further bounded by
``max_files_ingested_per_pass_per_folder`` so one folder full of files
can't monopolize a pass indefinitely; leftover files are picked up on the
next due poll.

Settle-window / partial-copy safety (D13, spec §10.5): a file is only
handed to ingest once its ``(size, mtime)`` pair has been observed
IDENTICAL on two consecutive polls of its own config's cadence -- tracked
durably per file in
:class:`~civiccast.schedule.media_lifecycle_models.WatchFolderFileState`
(the "ledger" the ``leave_with_ledger`` processed-file mode refers to) so
the check survives a daemon restart between polls. A file still being
written has a size that keeps growing between polls and therefore never
satisfies two consecutive identical observations until the copy finishes.

Reprocess-on-change: a file that was already ingested and then changes
again (same path, different size/mtime) is NOT treated as a brand-new
asset -- it re-enters the settle window, and once stable again is applied
via ``apply_replace_source`` against the SAME ``asset_id`` the ledger
already associated with that path, so the existing asset's readiness/
transcode state is correctly invalidated and recomputed for the new file
rather than creating a duplicate asset.
