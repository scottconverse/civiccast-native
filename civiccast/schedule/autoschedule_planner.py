"""Daypart slot expansion + repeat-prevention (CivicCast 3.0 — S18 slice 3).

The planning logic that sits between the data layer (slice 1) / query executor
(slice 2) and the rolling-window materializer (slice 4). Two pure-ish pieces:

* :func:`expand_block_slots` — expand a :class:`ScheduleBlock` (daypart) into
  the concrete :class:`SlotWindow` datetimes it covers across a date range.
  No DB, fully deterministic.
* :func:`repeat_prevention_asset_ids` — gather the asset ids already placed on
  a channel within a rule's repeat-prevention window, to feed
  ``autoschedule_query.pick_asset(exclude_asset_ids=…)`` so the same asset is
  not re-aired too soon. Reads ``schedule_items`` (the schedule of record).

Neither writes anything — composing slots + exclusions into actual
``schedule_items`` is the materializer's job (slice 4).

**Timezone.** Daypart times are *wall-clock* ("Prime time is 18:00-22:00").
:func:`expand_block_slots` takes an explicit ``tz`` (default UTC) and builds
each slot by combining the calendar date with the wall-clock time in that zone,
so a 18:00 start is 18:00 local on every day including DST-shift days (rather
than drifting an hour as a fixed offset from midnight would). The **source** of
the station's local zone is the caller's concern — CivicCast has no per-channel
tz config yet (egress channel config carries none), so the materializer/app
must supply it; until then UTC is the safe default. See the slice-3 audit
watch-items for the DST nonexistent/ambiguous-hour edge and the missing
station-tz config.
