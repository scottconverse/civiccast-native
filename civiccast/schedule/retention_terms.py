"""WP-08: value/unit/forever retention-term authoring (finalization plan
section 6, work package WP-08 -- "Add retention value/unit/forever
authoring without changing enforcement").

This module is deliberately small and dependency-free: it is the pure
arithmetic + validation layer for the new authoring contract. It does not
touch persistence, the API layer, or the enforcement worker.

Data contract (finalization plan, verbatim):

* Finite: a positive integer ``value`` plus a unit of ``days``, ``weeks``,
  ``months``, or ``years``.
* Infinite: ``forever``, which carries no numeric value.
* Days/weeks are elapsed-duration arithmetic (a fixed number of seconds).
* Months/years are calendar additions performed in the station's local
  timezone, clamped at end-of-month, leap-day safe, and converted to UTC
  only for the final persisted instant -- this keeps "1 year from a March
  publish" landing in March even though the number of elapsed UTC seconds
  in a year varies with DST and leap days.

This module never invents an anchor. Anchor capture/reuse is the caller's
(``civiccast.schedule.store``) responsibility -- see
``civiccast/schedule/models.py``'s ``Asset.retention_anchor_at`` docstring
for the immutability contract.

# it fell through to an uncaught 500 instead of a 422. A documented,
# generous ceiling closes that: 200 years, expressed per unit with a
# safety margin (366 days/year, 53 weeks/year, 12 months/year) so the
# bound never rejects a legitimate long-but-finite public-records term
# while still keeping every unit's arithmetic comfortably inside
# ``timedelta``'s own range (max ~2.7 million years) -- no unit can ever
# reach ``OverflowError`` through this bound. Enforced here (the single
# source of truth for both the Pydantic-level ``AssetMetadataUpdate``
# validator and this module's own arithmetic), not just at the API
# boundary, so a caller that bypasses Pydantic (the ephemeral store, a
# future direct caller) still cannot construct an overflow-prone term.
