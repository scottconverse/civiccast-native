"""Rolling-window materializer (CivicCast 3.0 — S18 slice 4).

The compiler that turns auto-schedule *rules* into concrete ``schedule_items``,
composing the slice-2 query executor and the slice-3 planner. Mirrors
periodic auto-schedule compiler's periodic compile (S18 §5 gap 1).

For each enabled :class:`AutoScheduleRule` it:

1. loads the rule's :class:`SavedSearch` + :class:`ScheduleBlock`;
2. expands the block into slot windows over the rule's rolling window
   (:func:`autoschedule_planner.expand_block_slots`);
3. computes the repeat-prevention exclusion set
   (:func:`autoschedule_planner.repeat_prevention_asset_ids`);
4. for each *unoccupied* slot, picks one asset
   (:func:`autoschedule_query.pick_asset`) and writes a ``published`` premiere
   ``schedule_item`` at the slot's start (auto-approved — see below).

**Auto-approved (Commit-to-Air enforcement, owner decision 2026-07-08).**
Materialized items are written directly in the ``published`` state, not
``scheduled``. A query rule's items are auto-approved because the operator
approved the *rule* itself when they created/enabled it — the Commit-to-Air
gate is the operator's per-item approval, and re-approving every rule-picked
slot one at a time would defeat the purpose of automation. A manually-added
schedule item (``PostgresScheduleStore.create``) still lands ``scheduled``
and requires an explicit commit before it airs.

**Idempotency.** Re-running the compile must not double-book. Before filling a
slot the materializer checks (in-memory, seeded per rule from the DB) whether
any non-cancelled, time-bounded item already overlaps it — covering prior
compile runs, manually-entered items, and items this run already placed. So a
re-run over the same horizon adds nothing.

**Transaction.** The materializer owns its ``session``: it writes
``ScheduleItem`` rows directly (rather than via ``PostgresScheduleStore.create``,
which manages its own session and would contend with these reads on SQLite),
each insert wrapped in a ``SAVEPOINT`` (``begin_nested``) so a Postgres
EXCLUDE-overlap race rolls back just that slot and the compile continues. It
commits per rule, so the next rule's occupancy seed sees the prior rule's items.
``last_materialized_at`` is stamped via the store after each rule (idempotency
makes the two-write non-atomicity safe — a re-run re-stamps and adds nothing).
