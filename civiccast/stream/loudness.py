    ``target_lufs`` / ``standard_label`` are parameterised (S11b per-sink
    loudness): cable normalises to ATSC A/85 -24 LKFS, streaming to -16 LUFS,
    EBU R128 to -23 LUFS — all measured by the same ITU-R BS.1770 meter. The
    result reports the *destination's* standard instead of a single hardcoded
    one, and the remediation hint names the actual target.

    ``probe_start_seconds``/``probe_duration_seconds`` (item 66 round-3,
    Opus review): both ``None`` (every caller except the source preparer)
    measures the WHOLE file, unchanged. When given, they bound the probe to
    a window instead -- ``probe_start_seconds`` seeks (``-ss`` before
    ``-i``) and ``probe_duration_seconds`` limits (``-t`` after ``-i``),
    the same convention ``build_conform_source_args`` uses. This is a
    deliberate accuracy/speed trade the caller opts into; it does not
    change what a whole-file probe would report for material with uniform
    loudness, and it can differ for material that varies significantly
    across its length -- callers that need the whole-file measurement must
    leave both ``None``.

    ``threads`` (item 66 round-4, Opus review; position fixed round-5):
    caps ffmpeg's decode AND filter-graph threading at that many threads
    (``-threads <N>`` before ``-i`` -- an input/decoder option, not an
    output one -- plus ``-filter_complex_threads <N>`` for the
    ``ebur128`` filter graph itself). A round-4 version of this placed
    ``-threads`` after ``-i``/``-t``, which ffmpeg parses as an OUTPUT
    option applying only to the ``-f null`` output -- it never actually
    capped the decode or filter-graph threads it was meant to bound. Not
    currently exercised by any caller in this codebase (the source
    preparer's silence-floor handling takes a second bounded sample
    instead of a whole-file fallback -- see item 66 round-5, point 3) but
    kept and correctly wired as a general capability of this function.
