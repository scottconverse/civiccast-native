"""Public router that serves packaged VOD + live HLS output over HTTP.

``civiccast.stream.packager`` writes a finished HLS package (multivariant
manifest + per-rendition variant playlists + segments) to a local directory
next to the source recording. Nothing served that tree to a browser —
``AssetMetadata.manifest_url`` was only ever non-null when an operator wired
up a CDN (Stage C) or set ``CIVICCAST_LIVE_MANIFEST_BASE_URL`` by hand. The
``/media/vod`` mount closes that gap: it serves the package tree for a
finalized asset at ``/media/vod/{asset_id}/...`` so a stock install has
something to play out of the box (see
``finalization_worker._servable_manifest_url``, which points
``manifest_url`` at this router by default when no CDN is set).

Lookup key is ``asset_id`` (the public, stable identity), resolved to the
package directory via ``LiveFinalizationJob.local_package_manifest_path`` —
the exact absolute path the worker wrote after packaging, so this router
never re-derives the recording-target resolution rules and cannot drift
from where the worker actually wrote the files.

``/media/live`` is the Sprint 0.4 live-HLS sibling: ``civiccast.egress.sinks
.HlsSink`` (a channel egress sink, wired through the persistent ffmpeg
encoder same as any other output) writes a rolling live manifest + segments
to a local directory. Lookup key is ``channel_id``, resolved to that
directory via the channel's configured ``hls`` egress sink URI (the egress
store, not a per-broadcast DB row — the live directory is a fixed,
continuously-overwritten location per channel, not a write-once package).
