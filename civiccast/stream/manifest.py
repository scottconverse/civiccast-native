"""HLS multivariant manifest assembly.

Builds RFC 8216-compliant HLS multivariant playlists from ``RenditionConfig``
descriptors. All five entries (4 content + slate) are always present per
ADR 0007.

Slate failover (Sprint 0.3 cleanup batch G — ADR 0007 v0.3 amendment):

  The slate is now declared as an alternate VIDEO rendition group via
  ``EXT-X-MEDIA TYPE=VIDEO,GROUP-ID="slate-fallback"`` and excluded from
  the standard ABR set. Each content ``EXT-X-STREAM-INF`` references the
  slate group with ``VIDEO="content"`` so a compliant HLS player can
  switch tracks within the rendition group when a content variant
  becomes unplayable. The slate's ``EXT-X-MEDIA`` carries
  ``DEFAULT=NO,AUTOSELECT=NO`` so clients only select it when explicitly
  directed (player API or hard failover).

  The v0.2 mechanism — advertise the slate as a STREAM-INF at 50 Mbps so
  estimate-matching ABR clients never pick it — is preserved as a
  belt-and-suspenders fallback inside ``build_multivariant_manifest``
  for older clients that ignore EXT-X-MEDIA failover groups. Modern
  clients (hls.js, native iOS/Safari, ExoPlayer) honor EXT-X-MEDIA and
  use the proper failover path.
