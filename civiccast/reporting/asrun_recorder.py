"""Store-backed as-run recorder (S23 §6.1) — the concrete engine seam impl.

The egress engine emits a proof event at every ACTUAL source transition; this
recorder turns each transition into an append-only ``AsRunLogEntry`` on the
durable franchise-compliance ledger (``as_run_log``, migration 0055). It is the
``civiccast.egress.asrun.AsRunRecorder`` protocol implementation, wired into the
daemon in ``build_channel_automation`` so the engine never imports the reporting
package directly.

Two responsibilities the engine cannot own (the engine emits one event per
*going-on-air* transition and has no notion of "the previous segment ended"):

1. **Open/close stitch.** A segment's ``actual_end`` is the ``actual_start`` of
   the next transition on that channel (or a terminal stop/error/drain). The
   recorder tracks the per-channel open ``entry_id`` and closes it (writing
   ``actual_end`` + ``duration_s``) when the next transition — or ``close_open``
   — arrives.
2. **station_id resolution.** The proof event / egress config carry only
   ``channel_id``; the as-run ledger is station-scoped. The recorder resolves
   the active station id the same way the metadata router does
   (``CIVICCAST_STATION_ID`` env, else the single-station default).

Two distinct failure modes are split (E-1 fix):

* **Schema drift** — an upstream ``channel_id`` / ``asset_id`` / station_id env
  value that fails the ``Slug`` pattern is raised as
  :class:`AsRunCaptureSchemaError` so the daemon can flag a degraded-mode
  marker. Silent swallow of these would erase the franchise-compliance ledger
  while playout continued, the exact "silent loss of as-aired log" failure the
  S23 slice exists to prevent.
* **Transport / DB failures** — connection drops, disk full, etc. — keep the
  current swallow-and-log behavior. Defense in depth keeps a transient DB
  hiccup off the playout path.

``verified=True`` always: the entry only exists because a proof event fired
(the encoder actually started).
