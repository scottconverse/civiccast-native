"""Real wall-clock live-delivery soak (0.8-0.9 release evidence).

The honest replacement for ``scripts/run_six_hour_soak.py``, whose loop body was
``time.sleep(60)`` — it exercised nothing and wrote "PASS". This soak actually
drives the system for hours, over **real TCP**, and its evidence is measured:

* a :class:`~civiccast.load.lab.RollingStation` rolls the live window on the
  real segment cadence **inside the server process**;
* the real serving + resolution + surge stack (built by
  :func:`~civiccast.load.switch_lab.build_switch_lab` — real ``live_router``,
  real ``/api/public/live/current``, real ``SurgeSwitchService`` publishing to
  an HTTP-served lab CDN edge) runs under uvicorn in a **child process**;
* emulated viewers poll over real sockets, re-resolving ``/current`` each cycle
  (the shipped portal behavior since 0.2.0), so the audience **rides the surge
  switch to the CDN and back** — every surge cycle exercises cold-start publish,
  hold-fresh, hysteresis release, and eviction;
* the parent samples the server process every minute — RSS, handles, threads —
  because the *point* of a soak is leak detection, and a soak that never looks
  at memory is theater.

PASS is computed from the samples, not asserted: zero 5xx, (near-)zero fetch
errors, sustained stalls within a small documented shared-lab budget (zero is
the dedicated-box expectation), the expected number of switch cycles observed,
and no meaningful RSS growth between the first post-warmup hour and the last
hour. The evidence renderer refuses to label a short run as long-run evidence.
