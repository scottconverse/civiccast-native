"""Opt-in, bounded PER-BATCH diagnostic for the live caption tap.

Field need (beta.10, 2026-09-21/22): one channel at a time went caption-empty
for 1-4 minutes and the identity ROTATED across channels. The overload gate was
also tripping at 3 settled segments against a max of 2. The available phase
timing answers "where does a scan's time go" in aggregate, but it cannot answer
"what happened to THIS batch":

* did this settled batch reach ASR, or was it discarded before any ASR ran?
* was the discard an overload, a paused-channel drain, or a storage refusal?
* how deep was the queue and how OLD was the oldest segment when the decision
  was made, and how long did the batch then take?
* which channel and session generation owned it - so a rotating episode can be
  attributed to a channel instead of averaged into a station-wide number?

This module answers exactly those questions and nothing else.

DESIGN CONSTRAINTS (all deliberate, mirroring
``civiccast.captions.phase_timing``):
* DEFAULT OFF. ``batch_diagnostic_from_env`` returns an inert collector unless
  ``CIVICCAST_CAPTION_TAP_BATCH_DIAGNOSTIC=1``. When off, NO clock is read and
  NO record is kept, so production behaviour is unchanged.
* BOUNDED. A hard cap on retained batch records and a wall-clock window
  measured from construction. Once either is exhausted the collector stops
  recording; the scan path is never made to fail or block because of it.
* METADATA ONLY. Channel, session generation, batch id, segment indices and
  file NAMES, queue depth, queue age, durations, counts and outcome/reason.
  No audio, no speech text, no cue text, no credentials, and no exception
  messages.
* FAILURE-PROOF. Every public method suppresses its own errors so a broken
  handler or a bad value can never change scan behaviour.
