"""Caption tap worker: live broadcast audio -> durable caption review queue.

Beta sprint B6 (decision #1 option A). The egress encoder forks live audio to
rolling WAV segments (:mod:`civiccast.captions.tap`); this worker bridges
those segments into the existing live caption seam
(:class:`~civiccast.captions.worker.LiveCaptionWorker`: pipeline →
two-window stabilization → durable review queue).

House worker shape (same as the finalization/Stage F workers):

- env settings with fail-fast ``from_env``
  (``CIVICCAST_CAPTION_TAP=off|inline|external``, default ``off`` — live
  captioning needs a transcription model, so a station opts in);
- ``run_once`` scans ``<tap_root>/<channel>/chunk-NNNNNN.wav``; a segment is
  consumed only when a newer-numbered segment exists (ffmpeg has moved on),
  so a half-written file is never read;
- consumed segments move to ``<channel>/processed/``, unreadable ones to
  ``<channel>/quarantine/`` — a scan never double-feeds and one bad file is
  never fatal;
- ``run_forever(poll_seconds, stop_event)`` survives and logs scan errors;
- inline mode runs under the app lifespan's ``ThreadSupervisor``; external
  mode is ``python -m civiccast.captions.tap_worker`` against the same env.

Chunk timing derives from the segment index times the configured segment
length, so cue timestamps line up with broadcast time even after restarts.

CAPTIONS ARE BEST EFFORT; PLAYOUT WINS. Three mechanisms enforce that here,
because on a real CPU-only station they did not:

- overload backs OFF (:mod:`civiccast.captions.tap_backoff`) -- a channel that
  cannot keep up is paused for an exponentially growing window instead of
  retrying, and re-logging, every scan;
- ASR concurrency is BOUNDED and hardware-aware -- CPU live captions keep one
  channel's ASR call in flight station-wide, while CUDA live captions allow up
  to three so a three-channel station can meet the five-second segment cadence
  (:func:`default_max_channel_workers`),
  and the CTranslate2 model itself runs with 1-2 intra-op threads,
  core-count-aware and capped
  (:func:`civiccast.captions.runtime.default_live_tap_cpu_threads`), instead
  of the batch/VOD default of "every core";
- the playout workers are spawned at ``ABOVE_NORMAL`` priority class, and the
  Python ASR threads here drop to ``BELOW_NORMAL``. The first of those is the
  load-bearing one; see :func:`_lower_current_thread_priority` for what the
  second does and does NOT cover.

#: elapsed on that station was p50 1.95 s, p90 5.73 s, MAX 19.08 s, so the

#: live station (U10 max per-batch ASR 19.08 s; U22 observed 19.5 s), so a

#: have to persist a whole window first. Three sheds inside five minutes
#: therefore requires at least ~90 s of over-limit scans in that span (three
#: whole persistence windows), which no transient produces. A channel that
#: genuinely cannot keep up sheds roughly once per persistence window (~30-40 s,
#: since a shed leaves exactly a legal batch of work), so it escalates to the
#: pause ladder after ~105 s instead of limping forever at a growing loss.
#:
#: ``1`` escalates on the very first shed; ``0`` disables catch-up entirely and

    """How many channels' ASR calls may be IN FLIGHT at once by default.

    MEASURED defect this bound originally replaced (tester DESKTOP-VBMA6O5,
    three channels ON_AIR): a prior flat default of 3, with each
    faster-whisper model built with ``cpu_threads=0`` ("use every core"), was
    part of a control plane burning ~247% of a core while the playout workers
    were starved into their own 10-second stall watchdog.

    CPU live captions remain flat at **1**, station-wide, regardless of core
    count.  A CUDA live runtime uses up to three channel workers, capped by
    the runtime's CTranslate2 ``num_workers``.  That distinction is required
    for the station's three five-second audio streams: serial 2.75-second GPU
    calls take roughly 8.25 seconds per cycle and inevitably build backlog,
    while three GPU calls in flight stay inside the segment interval.

    Item 79 (sandbox candidate 3b, 10 "Caption tap overload" events, the same
    GStreamer-worker-stall cluster as the tester's beta.4 soak) tightened CPU
    operation from the ``one concurrent channel per 8 CPUs, max 3`` formula.
    Every channel shares one
    :class:`~civiccast.captions.runtime.FasterWhisperRuntime` instance.  Its
    CPU live profile retains one CTranslate2 worker and the tap therefore
    retains one Python caller.  Its CUDA live profile has three CTranslate2
    workers, so this tap permits three callers to use that capacity.  A
    station with more ON_AIR channels than its selected bound can still spend
    most of a scan cycle waiting; when a channel's settled backlog stays over
    ``max_backlog_segments`` for the whole persistence window, it SHEDS its
    oldest settled audio and keeps captioning from the newest (U23) -- the
    pause ladder is retained only for a channel that sheds
    ``catch_up_shed_limit`` times inside ``catch_up_shed_window_seconds``, i.e.
    one that genuinely cannot keep up.

    Overridable end-to-end via ``CIVICCAST_CAPTION_TAP_MAX_CHANNEL_WORKERS``,

    WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO, stated plainly because an earlier version of this

    that calls ``transcribe`` and nothing else. CTranslate2 runs the actual
    inference on its own intra-op thread pool, created inside the native
    library at whatever priority the process had when the model was
    constructed -- i.e. ``NORMAL``. Those threads are where the CPU is
    genuinely spent, and this call does not reach them. On a saturated box the
    Python thread yields; the CT2 pool does not.

    The real, load-bearing protections for playout are the two that do not
    depend on thread priorities at all: the ASR concurrency bound plus a
    capped ``cpu_threads`` of 1-2 (:func:`civiccast.captions.runtime.default_live_tap_cpu_threads`,
    which limits how many CT2 threads exist in the first place), and the
    overload backoff (which stops the work entirely). This
    call is a cheap extra nudge on top of those, not a mechanism to rely on.
    Lowering the CT2 pool itself would mean running the live ASR in its own
    process at ``BELOW_NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS``; that is a larger change than
    this fix and is not attempted here.

    A no-op everywhere but Windows and on any failure: the hint is a
    protection for playout, never a precondition for captions. Cheap enough
    (one syscall) to re-apply per scan, which is required because the caption
    scan builds a fresh :class:`~concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` each
    time and therefore does not keep its worker threads.

        THE SEAM GUARANTEE. A window handed to ASR must be contiguous audio, so
        the batch after a shed must not overlap-join across the gap:

        * ``self._previous_segments`` is popped here.  ``_with_overlap`` would
          already refuse (its ``previous_index + 1 != index`` and
          ``abs(previous.end - current.start) <= tolerance`` guards both fail
          across a shed, which by construction leaves at least one whole segment
          between the last transcribed one and the first kept one) -- the pop is
          the belt to that suspenders, and it is what makes the intent explicit
          rather than incidental.

          ages pre-gap words OUT rather than confirming them, and on-air cues
          require word-time overlap across two windows.

        Keeping ``max_backlog_segments`` (rather than 1) is deliberate: it is
        exactly the size of the legal deferred batch this tap already submits,
        so catching up never issues a LARGER ASR call than the station was
        already making. Keeping 1 would resume on half a stabilizer window

        THE STARTUP GAP (U11 B1).  ``_discard_settled_segments`` runs only on an
        explicit START, i.e. from the daemon's ``channel_start_hook``. A
        restart of the control plane does not issue one, so a worker could come
        up over a directory still holding the previous broadcast's audio and
        count it as backlog. MEASURED on the live station (U10, 2026-09-24): the
        17:17:41 and 17:17:43 trips followed a service restart at ~17:17:2x,
        with the oldest queued segment 50.9-56.5 s old at trip time -- audio
        from BEFORE the restart, discarded only when someone pressed START.

        Why a construction-time watermark is sound here, and mtime is not: every
        chunk present at construction was produced by something other than this
        worker -- a previous process or a finished session -- so no writer's
        ownership has to be inferred from the filesystem. (The SCOPE LIMIT note
        on ``_begin_channel_session_locked`` records why file mtime cannot
        establish that, and that reasoning still holds.)

        Deliberately scoped to what exists NOW: a segment the tap writes after
        construction is this session's audio and is processed normally, even if
        the first scan has not run yet.

        Never fatal: the tap directory is an operator-managed surface, and a
        worker that cannot be constructed would take the control plane -- and
        the station -- down over a caption-tap cleanup.
