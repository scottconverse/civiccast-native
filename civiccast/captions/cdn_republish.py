"""Push a newly captioned VOD package back to the CDN it is served from.

:func:`civiccast.captions.vod.attach_reviewed_captions` writes to **local
disk**: the segmented WebVTT tracks, the flat English/Spanish sidecars, and
the rewritten multivariant manifest that declares them. For a station
serving VOD from its own portal origin that is the whole job.

For a station with ``CIVICCAST_CDN_PROVIDER`` set, whose package was pushed
to the CDN when it finalized -- *before* caption review finished -- it is
not. The CDN still holds the pre-caption manifest, so residents watching
through the CDN get a recording with no caption button at all while the
operator console says the job completed. That is exactly the shape of
completion claim CivicCast is not allowed to make: an English *and* Spanish
track is an owner requirement for a published recording, and "captioned on
the origin the public does not use" does not meet it.

This module closes that gap by re-uploading only what caption attach
changed -- the caption track playlists and segments, both flat sidecars,
and the rewritten manifest -- through the same
:func:`~civiccast.stream.cdn.package_upload.upload_package_files` helper the
finalization worker publishes with, so the manifest still lands last.

It re-uploads nothing when the station has no record of ever publishing
that package to *this* CDN. See :class:`CdnPackageTarget` for why that is
checked against the recorded manifest URL rather than assumed.
