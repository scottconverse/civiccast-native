#: Bounded retry for the live-sidecar atomic replace.

#: service logged PermissionError [WinError 5] from
#: temporary.replace(destination) three times in ~8 h. On Windows a rename can
#: fail with ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED when another process (real-time virus scanning
#: or the search indexer are the live candidates here) holds a transient handle
#: on the freshly-fsynced temp file. A short bounded retry shrinks that window.
#:
#: This is a MITIGATION, not a fix for the trigger. It cannot recover a
#: permanent ACL/lock problem and it does not remove the external handle; if
#: every attempt is refused the original error is re-raised so the caller can
#: record it. A failure must never be swallowed into a silent success.
