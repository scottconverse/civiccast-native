"""Real provider-registry-backed readiness for Publish preflight and approval.

WP-03 (audit findings QA-001 / ENG-001 readiness portion): preflight and
approval used to read readiness from two different sources -- preflight from
a deterministic mock credential store (``civiccast.publish.credentials``,
now removed) that always reported "healthy" unless a test explicitly told it
otherwise, while approval resolved the real ``civiccast.platform.providers``
registry. A station that set ``CIVICCAST_PROVIDER_YOUTUBE=real`` with no
credentials therefore saw preflight say ``ready=true`` and then got an
uncaught ``ProviderConfigurationError`` (a 500) on approval.

This module is the single readiness source both preflight
(:func:`civiccast.publish.service.build_publish_preflight`) and approval
(:func:`civiccast.publish.service.approve_publish`) call, so they read the
same registry and cannot disagree about configuration readiness (plan item
8). It never performs a network call or write -- ``describe_provider`` is
documented side-effect-free, and this module only adds read-only lookups on
top of it.
