"""Real subscriber delivery for the Publish subscriber-notifications surface.

WP-05 (audit findings ENG-001, UX-003, TEST-001, QA-003, DOC-004). The defect
this module closes: ``approve_publish`` built a
:class:`~civiccast.subscribe.models.NotificationPayload`, marked the surface
``succeeded``, and returned. It never called
:func:`civiccast.subscribe.service.dispatch_notifications`. No subscriber was
ever contacted, and a green surface was the only thing an operator saw.

What replaces it:

* the canonical resolver (:mod:`civiccast.publish.targets`) says which targets
  this asset publishes to, and the same resolver filters the public RSS feed;
* the existing SMTP / HMAC-webhook adapters, encrypted subscriber store and
  webhook retry queue do the actual sending -- none of that is reimplemented;
* every attempt lands in the durable ``notification_delivery_outcomes`` table
  under a stable logical key, so re-approval is idempotent and a partial or
  queued fan-out cannot present as fully successful.

Podcast timing: the owner's 2026-09-01 decision turned Podcast into a "coming
soon" card, so there is no podcast job in this beta and never a podcast URL to
wait for. Notices are portal-only and go immediately. The plan's
"wait for Podcast terminal state" rule is deliberately not implemented -- there
is nothing to wait for, and a timer with no job behind it would be a fiction.
