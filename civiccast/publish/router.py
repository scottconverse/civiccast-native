    Two packaging conventions exist and only one of them is under the upload
    root, so asking ``resolve_vod_package_dir`` alone gets a LIVE-finalized
    recording wrong:

    * **live-finalized** -- ``LiveFinalizationWorker._package_once`` writes to
      ``<recording_path.parent>/<live_session_id>-hls/`` and records the
      manifest on the finalization job. Nothing about it is under
      ``CIVICCAST_UPLOAD_DIR``, and a station broadcasting live may not have
      an upload root configured at all.
    * **uploaded** -- ``.civiccast-packages/<asset_id>`` under the upload root.

    Live is checked first, through the same ``finalization_worker.get_status``
    seam :func:`_resolve_local_recording` already uses. This closes the "a
    live-finalized recording would transcribe but fail to attach" follow-up in
    docs/ops/background-workers.md -- and, now that a missing package
    directory blocks approval rather than merely failing stage two later, it
    is what keeps a live station with no upload root from being told it cannot
    publish.

    **How far the agreement with the media-serving path actually goes.** The
    *live-finalized precedence* matches
    ``civiccast.stream.media_router._package_dir_for_asset``: the finalization
    job's manifest path wins there too. The upload branch does NOT match. That
    function additionally checks the asset's ``manifest_url`` suffix, verifies
    the resolved directory is contained by the package root and the package
    root by the upload root, and requires ``playlist.m3u8`` to exist -- and,
    failing all that, falls back to the legacy pre-rc14 shared
    ``<file_path>/hls`` location. This resolver does none of that: it returns
    the standard ``.civiccast-packages/<asset_id>`` path from
    ``resolve_vod_package_dir`` without existence or containment checks.

    Known gap, stated rather than papered over: a **legacy pre-rc14 package**
    living at ``<file_path>/hls`` is not resolved here, so the caption gate
    would refuse to queue -- and therefore block publish -- for such an asset
    even though the media router can still serve it. The blast radius is
    stations upgraded across rc14 that still hold pre-rc14 packages; new
    packaging never writes that path. Close it by resolving through a shared
    helper if that population turns out to matter.

    Publishing is the trigger because "captioned published files" is the
    legal obligation the offline caption path exists to meet — the moment
    a recording becomes a public record is the moment its captions become
    owed. The job transcribes with the station's staged caption model and
    files every cue in the operator review queue; nothing reaches the
    resident-facing package until an operator has decided on it.

    **Raises** :class:`CaptionJobNotQueueableError` when the job cannot be
    queued. It used to swallow every failure and log, on the reasoning that
    captioning trails publication and must not fail the publish. The half of
    that reasoning which is still true — captioning trails publication, and a
    public record must not wait days for caption review — is preserved by
    when this runs, not by ignoring its result: the approval route calls it
    *before* approving, so the operator gets a controlled 409 naming the
    cause and nothing is published, rather than a public recording with no
    caption job and only a line in a log file to say so.

    ``require_published=False`` is that pre-approval call: the asset has not
    been marked public yet, so the ``published_at`` check must not veto it.
    The trade is explicit — if the approval that follows then fails, the
    asset has a queued caption job it did not need yet. That is bounded and
    harmless: the job is idempotent per asset (so the operator's retry reuses
    it rather than transcribing twice), and the worker publishes nothing on
    its own — it fills the review queue and waits for an operator either way.
