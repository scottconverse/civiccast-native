    """Authenticate every /api/staff/* request and attach operator identity.

    Failed verifications are rate-limited per client IP (audit item #27):
    without this, /api/staff/* is an unthrottled bearer-token oracle. Only
    FAILURES count -- valid requests are never recorded against the limit, so
    a noisy client sharing the operator's proxy/NAT cannot deny access. The
    key is the client IP alone, NOT ip+token-prefix: per-prefix buckets hand a
    token-rotating brute-forcer a fresh budget per guess. Once saturated,
    exact full-token matches bypass the unknown-token budget. Exact misses
    receive 429 plus Retry-After without expensive verification or a queue in
    front of a valid operator.
    State is process-local, so ingress controls remain required for distributed
    or multi-worker lookup and request load.

    OWNER DECISION 2026-08-30 (audit finding #1, day-one-lockout fix): a
    request carrying NO Authorization header at all is not a failed
    credential guess -- it is the ordinary state of a signed-out browser
    loading any staff-console page, and every one of those page loads calls
    this same middleware. Before this fix, a missing header was verified via
    the same code path as a wrong token, so it both consumed the failure
    budget (a handful of ordinary, credential-free page loads exhausted it)
    and was itself blocked by the saturation pre-check below once that
    budget ran out -- a brand-new operator who had never typed a password
    could 429-lock themselves out just by opening the console. A missing
    header is now recognized before either the pre-check or the budget is
    touched, and always gets a plain 401 with no rate-limit interaction. A
    present-but-wrong, malformed, revoked, or expired token still counts,
    exactly as before.
