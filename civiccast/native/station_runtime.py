"""Resolve one activated native station into its control-plane environment.

The native bootstrap promotes a complete, signed five-pack station into one
version root.  This module is the runtime half of that contract: the Windows
service derives the active root from its embedded Python executable, validates
the persisted station-set and pre-activation receipt, then launches the control
plane with captions and GStreamer enabled against the exact installed pack.

WP1 adaptive-tier note (owner architecture, settled): captions ship with a
MEDIUM floor tier; large-v3 is OPTIONAL. Startup therefore resolves whichever
verified caption tier is actually staged -- the floor tier at the acquisition
flow's staging location (``packs/captions-floor/models/faster-whisper-medium``)
and/or large-v3 inside its signed component -- routing the choice through
:func:`civiccast.native.caption_tier_selection.select_caption_tier` so the
selection is explicit and provable, never a silent substitution. A staged
tier that fails verification is a hard, fail-closed error exactly as the
original mandatory large-v3 gate was; only a tier that is genuinely absent
is skipped.

Two installed states are legitimately not startable yet and are typed so the
Windows service supervisor can degrade gracefully instead of crashing:

* :class:`NativeStationNotActivatedError` -- the installer's payload
  extraction lays only ``runtime/`` and ``packs/``; ``station-set.json`` and
  ``activation-self-test.json`` are written ONLY by the later
  acquisition/activation flow. An ABSENT ``station-set.json`` is therefore
  installed-but-not-yet-activated, not corruption.
* :class:`NativeStationCaptionsUnavailableError` -- an activated station
  with NO caption tier staged at all (captions unavailable/degraded).

A PRESENT-but-corrupt artifact of any kind stays the loud parent
:class:`NativeStationConfigurationError`.

       ``("cpu", "int8")``, the pack contract's validated baseline.

    A wrong ``cuda`` here degrades instead of killing captions: the runtime
    side (``FasterWhisperRuntime._model_instance``) falls back to cpu/int8
    with a logged warning when the CUDA backend cannot load. That fallback
    stays in place as a second line of defense (e.g. the override forces
    cuda without libs), but is no longer the ONLY defense -- the presence
    gate above means a capable machine with no component pack installed
    lands on cpu/int8 the first time, never via a caught load failure. Known,
    documented proxy limitation: VRAM cannot see tensor-core generation — a
    pre-tensor-core card with enough VRAM AND libs present will still be
    selected and may caption slower than the CPU would (the GTX 1660 Ti
    measured 30/30 deadline misses on GPU); the operator override above is
    the remedy until a measured-capability probe exists.

    Called only when the closure DIRECTORY is present
    (``<runtime>/dependencies/gstreamer``). Resolves egress in three tiers and
    returns the child environment the control plane should run with:

    1. **DETECT.** ``installed_gstreamer_environment`` validates the closure.
       It raises :class:`GstreamerRuntimeError` for a PARTIAL / reparse-point /
       AV-quarantined / interrupted-install closure -- "present but broken",
       a non-malicious, recoverable state, distinct from "absent". K2 (PR #404)
       left this call unwrapped, so that exception propagated out through
       ``station_environment_for_python`` into the supervisor's dependency
       wiring (whose ``try/except`` only catches the unrelated
       ``NativeStationNotActivatedError``) and crashed the WHOLE supervisor --
       all streaming, not just GStreamer egress. It is caught here and NEVER
       propagates: the supervisor must not crash on any tier of this path.
    2. **SELF-REPAIR ONCE.** ``repair_hook`` (default
       :func:`reverify_gstreamer_closure`) re-verifies the closure in place a
       single time -- recovering a transient AV lock without taking the channel
       off air. If it now reports healthy, GStreamer runs normally: the keys
       are injected and this returns the GStreamer-enabled environment. (The
       destructive signed re-stage that can rebuild genuinely missing bytes is
       the operator RECOVERY action, not an automatic boot step -- see
       :func:`reverify_gstreamer_closure`.)
    3. **FALL BACK TO FFmpeg.** If repair does not restore the closure, egress
       switches to the FFmpeg concat engine
       (``CIVICCAST_EGRESS_ENGINE=ffmpeg-concat``) so
       ``engine_select.build_encoder_strategy`` selects ``ConcatEncoderStrategy``
       and the CHANNEL KEEPS AIRING on FFmpeg (the Codex P1 on PR #406). A
       loud ERROR is logged, and :data:`EGRESS_DEGRADED_REASON_ENV` is set so
       the control-plane seam that holds a DB session
       (``egress.automation.build_channel_automation``) raises the operator
       alert and marks the channel DEGRADED -- this module runs pre-DB under
       LocalSystem and cannot do either itself.

    A closure that verifies clean on the FIRST look never enters tiers 2-3: it
    returns the GStreamer-enabled environment unchanged in shape from before
    this state machine existed.
