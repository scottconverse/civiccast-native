"""Element policy and dependency-closure core for the native Windows runtime.

Implements the pure half of `spec-packaging-closure`: which GStreamer plugins
the shipped runtime is allowed to contain (D3, "no GPL in the shipped
runtime"), and the static PE-import walk that turns those plugins into the
complete set of files the installer must lay down (D2).

Everything here is deliberately free of filesystem and PE parsing. The build
script (`scripts/build_native_runtime_closure.py`) supplies `imports_of` and
`resolve` backed by `pefile` and a staged upstream tree; the tests supply
dictionaries. The graph logic is therefore provable without shipping fixture
binaries, and the same code runs in both places.

Why a checked-in factory->plugin table instead of probing the build machine:
Media Foundation and NVENC register their factories only when the host has
matching GPU hardware, so `Gst.ElementFactory.find` returns different answers
on different build boxes. Deriving the closure from a live probe would make
the shipped tree machine-dependent and break AC1 (two clean runs from the same
pinned inputs must produce identical SHA256SUMS). The table is derived from
measured evidence and guarded by tests; runtime factory availability is a
separate question answered by the doctor probe on the operator's machine.
