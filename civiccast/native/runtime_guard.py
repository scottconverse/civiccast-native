"""The pure D3 decision table plus the continuous-enforcement monitor.

``decide`` is the whole hazard boundary for the native (Windows) half of the
dual-runtime exclusion guard (charter Sec.6 / gate 4, spec
``spec-dual-runtime-guard.md``): a pure, total function from
:class:`~civiccast.native.models.GuardInputs` to
:class:`~civiccast.native.models.GuardDecision`. It performs no I/O -- every
probe result is composed by the caller (real probes in
``civiccast.native.win_probes`` on Windows, fakes in tests everywhere).

This module also owns the registry/serialization contracts that
``win_probes`` and the CLI verbs read/write (kept here, not duplicated,
because they are the vocabulary ``decide`` is defined in terms of).

Disclosed interpretation decisions (brief-resolved ambiguities; the auditor
reads this list -- see also ``evidence/DESIGN-NOTES.md`` for the full set
including the ones that live outside this module):

1. **Selector unreadable -> blocked_probe_unavailable, not refuse.** D1
   defines "absent" as a value, not what happens when the read itself fails
   (wrong registry type, or a string that isn't exactly native/wsl/absent).
   Spec D3's table has no explicit row for "selector unreadable"; this
   module treats it the same as every other probe-can't-be-trusted case: a
   non-authorizing, bounded retry (10s), never a permanent both-stopped
   deadlock -- consistent with D3's own closing sentence ("an *error* is
   never escalated into a permanent both-stopped deadlock").
2. **A3 error -> blocked_probe_unavailable, not refuse.** A3 "error"
   (mutex API failure, distinct from "denied") means the guard cannot
   arbitrate ownership at all, so it cannot prove exclusivity either way --
   non-authorizing per the same D3 principle, not a conflict signal.
3. **A1 run_entry error under selector=native is ignored, not degraded.**
   The Run-entry sub-signal is a PRESENCE-only signal (D2: it only counts
   combined with selector != native). Under selector=native it is already
   disregarded when positive, so a failed *read* of it carries no
   information the decision needs -- only ``a1.live_process`` errors trigger
   ``start_degraded``. Silently degrading on a signal the table never
   consults would be theater, not caution.
4. **Mid-operation refusal state mapping (blocked_wsl_active).** ``decide``
   itself never sets ``state_name="blocked_wsl_active"`` -- that is a
   :class:`GuardMonitor`-level relabeling applied only when a non-start
   decision follows a start (D5's controlled-stop path), including the
   selector-flips-to-wsl-mid-operation case (AC7). See ``GuardMonitor``'s
   docstring.
5. **An EXPLICIT selector is the authority basis; an unreadable A2 under it
   degrades rather than blocks (chain I, owner-decided 2026-08-01).** D3's
   row 4 originally read "| native | A2 unreadable/timeout |
   NON-AUTHORIZING: blocked_probe_unavailable". Its stated justification is
   "A2 is the WSL-transmitter lifetime proof; transmission never starts on
   its absence" -- but that reasoning is what the SELECTOR exists to settle.
   The guard's own blocked message says what is missing: "cannot establish
   the authority basis for a native start". A validly-read
   ``ActiveRuntime=native`` -- exact match, REG_SZ, machine-global,
   admin-writable only (D1), and since chain G actually WRITTEN by the
   native installer -- IS that authority basis. So in exactly one cell
   (selector explicitly ``"native"`` AND A2 unreadable AND nothing else
   blocking) the start proceeds as ``start_degraded``, naming A2, and the
   unreadability is logged as a structured warning by the supervisor
   (``supervisor.core._log_guard_degraded``) instead of withholding the
   station. This reuses D3 row 3's EXISTING degraded vocabulary
   ("start + log ``probe-degraded``, re-probe per D5") rather than inventing
   a new one, and D5's continuous enforcement is untouched: ``start_degraded``
   is in ``_STARTED_ACTIONS``, so the monitor keeps re-probing every interval
   and a later POSITIVE A2 still triggers the controlled stop.

   What does NOT move (each is pinned by its own falsification test):

   * selector ``"absent"`` (even with a CONFIRMED-False WSL install, which
     reaches the same native path) -- no selector was ever written, so there
     is no authority artifact to stand on: still ``blocked_probe_unavailable``.
   * selector unreadable (step 2) and selector ``"wsl"`` (step 3).
   * step 4's ``absent`` + ``wsl_install_detected is None``.
   * a READABLE A2 ``positive`` under ``native`` (step 6) -- a real conflict,
     not probe noise: still ``refuse``.
   * ``a3 == "acquired_abandoned"`` + A2 unreadable (step 7) -- D4's MANDATORY
     abandoned-mutex re-verify. An abandoned mutex is affirmative evidence
     that a prior owner died holding it, which is not probe noise either;
     that row is deliberately left blocking and is NOT part of this cell.
   * A3 ``denied``/``error`` and the interlock rows.

   Exactly 18 of the exhaustive table's 3888 points change; a differential
   test against a pre-chain-I oracle asserts the set of changed points is
   EXACTLY that cell (``tests/native/test_guard_table.py``).

Cross-spec note: ``blocked_probe_unavailable`` is mandated by this spec's
D3/AC9 but is absent from ``spec-supervisor.md`` D6's state enumeration --
surfaced here explicitly, not silently resolved; ws5's supervisor spec needs
to account for it when it lands.

    HOLDS that one mutex instance's ownership across its own lifetime
    (construct one ``RuntimeOwnerMutex``, call ``mutex.acquire()`` or
    equivalently let the first ``probe()`` do it, then wire
    ``mutex=mutex.probe`` here) -- ``.probe()`` confirms continued
    self-ownership on every subsequent evaluation WITHOUT reopening or
    re-waiting the kernel object. Wiring ``.acquire`` directly re-opens the
    object every 30s even when this process already owns it; an unelevated
    holder cannot reopen the production-DACL object it already owns
    (CreateMutex's second-open DACL check), so every evaluation after the
    first spuriously observes a denial and the monitor controlled-stops
    itself within one interval of starting. A genuinely LOST mutex (another
    process somehow acquired it) still surfaces through ``probe()`` as a
    real ``refuse``, which is correct -- ``probe()`` only skips the reopen
