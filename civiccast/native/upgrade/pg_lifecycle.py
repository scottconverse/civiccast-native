"""D3's SCOPED postgres lifecycle (BLOCKER #49).

Live-proven defect (``.agent-runs/native-windows/ws5-installer/evidence/
gauntlet-run11/``, row-4b): the documented update path (uninstall preserving
the DB cluster + HKLM ``DatabaseUrl``/``InstalledVersion``, then reinstall)
runs the D3 upgrade engine (:mod:`civiccast.native.upgrade`) BEFORE D4
provisioning in the NSIS chain. Uninstall removes the ``CivicCastSupervisor``
service, so nothing is running postgres when D3 starts; the engine's very
first DB touch -- ``seams.schema_revision()``, called immediately after the
phase-0 journal write in :func:`civiccast.native.upgrade.orchestrator.
run_upgrade` -- faults with an uncaught connection error, mapping to engine
exit 40 / installer exit 115.

This module wraps exactly that first DB-touching seam with a narrow decision,
confined to the CLI entry path (:mod:`civiccast.native.upgrade.__main__`) so
``orchestrator.py`` stays PURE (never touches Windows/Postgres/subprocess
itself -- see that module's docstring):

* reachable                              -> do nothing; never stop what we
                                             did not start (not ours to
                                             manage).
* unreachable, CivicCastSupervisor ABSENT
  from the SCM (:func:`civiccast.native.upgrade.service_control.
  _real_service_registered_probe`, landed 1cf3e938 -- absent is PROVABLE,
  nothing else can own postgres) -> start postgres against the preserved
  data dir via the ONE blessed pg_ctl wrapper
  (:mod:`civiccast.native.supervisor.children`'s ``postgres_child_spec`` /
  ``graceful_stop_action`` -- this module introduces NO second pg_ctl
  call-site, it only supplies the ``subprocess.run`` children.py
  deliberately does not), run the engine, and stop postgres again in a
  ``finally`` (never left running for D4 provisioning to trip over).
* unreachable, service PRESENT (or its absence could not be confirmed) ->
  fail closed (unchanged behavior) with a message naming the actual
  condition instead of an uncaught traceback.

Data dir / pg_ctl path / host / port are derived exactly the way D4
provisioning does (:func:`civiccast.native.provision.__main__.
resolve_provision_paths`) plus the database_url the rest of the engine
already connects to -- no new path or endpoint convention is invented here.

The wrapping is applied to ``schema_revision`` specifically because it is
the first (and, on a resumed run starting at a later phase, one of the
only) DB-touching seams invoked -- see :func:`wrap_schema_revision`. A
resumed upgrade whose first forward step is drain/backup (i.e. it never
calls ``schema_revision`` before those) is NOT covered by this scoped fix;
that gap is disclosed, not silently papered over (see the WP report).

Every real primitive here (subprocess pg_ctl invocation, SQLAlchemy
connection, SCM query) is lazily imported/executed only when the wrapped
seam actually runs, matching the house pattern in ``seams.py`` and
``service_control.py``; the DECISION logic (:func:`wrap_schema_revision`) is
pure over injected callables so it is fully unit-tested without Windows,
Postgres, or the SCM.
