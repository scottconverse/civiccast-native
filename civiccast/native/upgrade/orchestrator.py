"""The D3 journaled upgrade sequence, its rollback, and its halt path.

This module is PURE ORCHESTRATION over the injected
:class:`~civiccast.native.upgrade.models.UpgradeSeams`. It never touches
Windows, Postgres, or the supervisor itself -- every real action is a seam.
That is what lets a fake-seam test exercise the REAL state machine (the same
code that runs in production), rather than a re-implementation of it.

The forward sequence (spec D3):

  1 acquire interlock              -> INTERLOCK_ACQUIRED
  2 drain writers + verify quiesce -> WRITERS_DRAINED
  3 verified pre-upgrade backup    -> BACKUP_VERIFIED   (recovery point exists)
  4 lay app\\<new>\\ + flip junction -> TREE_LAID          (records prev target)
  5 alembic upgrade head           -> MIGRATED           (records post revision)
  6 maintenance/read-only health   -> HEALTH_GREEN
  7 release interlock (commit)     -> COMPLETE

Failure handling (spec D3, exact):

* A failure BEFORE the mutation frontier (before MIGRATED) unwinds the
  filesystem only: flip the junction back to the recorded previous target (if
  a flip happened) and release the interlock -> ROLLED_BACK. The database was
  never mutated, so no restore is needed.
* A failure AT or AFTER MIGRATED flips the junction back AND restores the
  step-3 backup, so the old binary never runs against a newer schema. Success
  -> ROLLED_BACK.
* If that restore itself fails, HALT: ensure the service is stopped (never
  running on a wrong schema), preserve the verified backup + journal, and emit
  the operator recovery document -> HALTED_RESTORE_FAILED.
* A release whose migration is declared non-restorable
  (``plan.migration_restorable=False``) with no ``operator_ack`` is refused at
  phase 0 -> REFUSED_NON_RESTORABLE.

Resume (idempotent): :func:`run_upgrade` reads any existing journal for the
context and continues from its recorded boundary. Because the on-disk phase is
only advanced AFTER its real action succeeds and is persisted, a kill at any
boundary leaves a journal the resume can drive to a clean COMPLETE or a clean
rollback. Each forward step is individually idempotent (see the per-step
docstrings), so re-running a step whose effect already landed is safe.
