"""Real (production) service-control seams for the D3 upgrade engine (WP-4).

WP-3 shipped the pure orchestrator + journal and left THREE seams unwired,
raising ``NotImplementedError`` from
:func:`civiccast.native.upgrade.__main__._resolve_service_control_seams`
(they cross into the Windows Service Control Manager + the running supervisor).
This module wires all three to real production callables:

* **drain_and_verify_quiescence** (D3 step 2). The D7a maintenance interlock is
  ALREADY held (step 1): every native start path honors it and the RUNNING
  supervisor, observing the held interlock, transitions to ``maintenance`` --
  it controlled-stops the writer-capable control plane and starts NO media
  workers, while Postgres stays up (the read path the backup/migrate
  need). We therefore do NOT issue a service/graceful stop here (that would
  also stop Postgres, which the pre-upgrade backup and ``alembic upgrade`` both
  connect to). Instead we (a) CONFIRM the writers actually drained by polling
  the supervisor's own status over the D7 control pipe until
  ``workers_permitted`` is False (or budget), and (b) PROVE quiescence exactly
  as D3 names it -- WS2 ``snapshot_tables`` equality across a settle interval:
  if any writer were still landing rows the two snapshots differ and we refuse.
  Both gates are fail-closed.
* **health_gate** (D3 step 6). SCM-start the service (idempotent) -- with the
  interlock held it comes up in maintenance/read-only mode -- then poll the
  supervisor's OWN maintenance-readiness gate
  (:func:`civiccast.native.supervisor.children.check_control_plane_maintenance_ready`,
  reused verbatim, not re-implemented) until it attests green (or budget).
* **stop_service** (D3 halt path). SCM-stop the service so no binary runs
  against a schema it does not match; tolerate "already stopped", raise on a
  genuine SCM failure (the halt must know its stop actually happened).

House pattern (mirrors :mod:`civiccast.native.win_probes` and
:mod:`civiccast.native.upgrade.seams`): the seam LOGIC is pure over injected
OS/DB primitives so it runs under fakes on Linux/CI; the real Win32 SCM, the
control-pipe round trip, the ``/health`` GET, and the live-Postgres snapshot
are lazily bound and only fire on the elevated install host (the WP-5 live
matrix). ``import civiccast.native.upgrade.service_control`` must succeed on
Linux -- every pywin32/registry import is lazy, inside the function that needs
it.
