"""Upgrade-vs-fresh routing for the D3 install/upgrade engine (chain K/K2).

WHAT WENT WRONG (real hardware R7, 2026-08-01, request 0053b). The machine had
NO installed product -- 0 Add/Remove Programs entries, no ``CivicCastSupervisor``
service (``sc query`` -> 1060), no install directory. What it DID have was data
left behind on purpose by the previous uninstall: ``C:\\ProgramData\\CivicCast``
and the HKLM values under ``Software\\CivicCast\\Native``. The installer routed
that into the UPGRADE engine and logged ``old=1.0.0-rc15 new=1.0.0-rc15`` --
an "upgrade" from a version to itself, on a machine with nothing installed.
The engine then drained writers that did not exist and failed at the
pre-upgrade backup.

The routing gate lived in NSIS (``nsis-hooks-bootstrap.nsh``) and keyed on two
registry values::

    ${If} $R0 == "none"        ; InstalledVersion absent
      ${AndIf} $R2 == ""       ; DatabaseUrl absent
      ... skip the D3 engine

Both of those values SURVIVE uninstall by deliberate design (see
``native_uninstall.rs``'s ``NATIVE_D4_STATE_INVENTORY``: they are the credential
for, and the version stamp of, the PostgreSQL cluster that uninstall
deliberately preserves). So they are data-remnant signals, not
product-existence signals, and the gate could never fire on a machine that had
ever held a successful install.

THE SIGNAL THIS MODULE USES INSTEAD: the ``CivicCastSupervisor`` service being
registered in the Service Control Manager. Every other candidate was
considered and rejected on evidence:

* **ARP entry / registered uninstaller.** Tauri's generated install section
  writes the Add/Remove Programs entry (DisplayVersion included) and
  ``uninstall.exe`` BEFORE ``NSIS_HOOK_POSTINSTALL`` runs. By the time any
  routing decision executes, both are always present and always describe the
  version being installed RIGHT NOW. Proven live, Sandbox matrix row 1
  (2026-07-30): an ARP-keyed gate never fired at all.
* **``InstalledVersion`` / ``DatabaseUrl``.** Preserved across uninstall by
  design (inventory rows 2 and 4). This is exactly what R7 had.
* **``$INSTDIR\\CivicCast Native.exe`` / the install tree.** The installer has
  already written it by POSTINSTALL time.
* **``C:\\ProgramData\\CivicCast``.** Preserved across uninstall by design; it
  is the data root, which is the thing a fresh install must ADOPT.

The service is the only tracked D4 item that is both CREATED by a successful
install (``--civiccast-register-native-service``) and REMOVED by a successful
uninstall (``--civiccast-teardown-native-state``; inventory row 1). R7's own
evidence records both halves: ``sc.exe query CivicCastSupervisor`` returned
1060 (``ERROR_SERVICE_DOES_NOT_EXIST``) after uninstall while the registry
values remained. It is also the CAUSALLY correct signal: D3's drain seam reads
a running supervisor's D7 control pipe and its health gate SCM-starts the
service, so with no registered service those steps cannot mean anything even
if they somehow succeeded.

The same probe already gates the install-over-existing classification in
``NSIS_HOOK_PREINSTALL`` and the D3 drain's writers-active check
(``service_control._real_service_registered_probe``) -- this module reuses that
question rather than inventing a fourth product-existence convention.

WHERE THE DECISION LIVES. In Python, not NSIS. The hook file's own stated
contract is that "all D3 logic ... lives in tested Python
(civiccast.native.upgrade), never in NSIS script"; the routing gate was the
one piece that violated it, and it is the piece that broke. NSIS now passes
the signals it can read and branches on the engine's exit code.
