"""Default (real) seam implementations for the D3 upgrade engine.

The orchestrator is pure over :class:`~civiccast.native.upgrade.models.UpgradeSeams`;
this module builds the PRODUCTION bundle that wires each seam to the real
machinery already proven elsewhere in the tree:

* interlock  -> :mod:`civiccast.native.win_probes` (D7a, ws4)
* backup     -> :func:`civiccast.dr.backup.run_full_backup` + a restore-drill
                spot check via :func:`civiccast.dr.restore_drill.run_postgres_restore_drill`
                (WS2). Verification is "artifact hash + restore-drill spot check"
                exactly as D3 step 3 requires.
* restore    -> :func:`civiccast.dr.backup.run_postgres_restore` (WS2)
* migrate    -> ``alembic.command.upgrade(cfg, "head")`` against the live DB,
                using the same path resolution the startup schema check uses
                (:func:`civiccast.schema_check._alembic_runtime_paths`)
* schema rev -> :func:`civiccast.schema_check.read_db_revision`
* junction   -> :mod:`civiccast.native.upgrade.junction`

Three seams are service-control actions (drain writers, start the
maintenance/read-only health gate, stop the service). Those cross into the
Windows Service Control Manager + the running supervisor. WP-4 wired them to
real production callables in
:mod:`civiccast.native.upgrade.service_control` (SCM start/stop, the D7
control-pipe status read, the ``/health`` maintenance attestation, and the WS2
snapshot-equality quiescence proof). :func:`build_default_seams` therefore
REQUIRES the caller to pass those three callables rather than shipping a fake
default that would silently no-op a safety-critical step; ``__main__`` supplies
them via ``service_control.resolve_service_control_seams``. Their real OS/DB
round trips fire only on the elevated install host (the WP-5 live matrix).

    replay the dump into a genuinely empty database inside ONE transaction so a

      dump written after the manifest used to pass ``verified=True``, because

    WP-4 wired them in :mod:`civiccast.native.upgrade.service_control`
    (``resolve_service_control_seams``): SCM start for the maintenance health
    gate, SCM stop for the halt path, and a control-pipe drain-confirm + WS2
    snapshot-equality check for drain; ``__main__`` passes them here.

    ``command_database_url`` passes straight through to :func:`default_backup`
    (see its own docstring) -- ``None`` in every production call, which keeps
    behavior unchanged (one reachable Postgres, no container indirection).
