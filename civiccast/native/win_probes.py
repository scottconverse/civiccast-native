"""The real Windows-backed probes -- this module is the seam's real side.

Every registry/process/wsl.exe-touching function here takes injectable roots
or runners so the same code is exercised by fakes in unit tests and by the
real OS in ``tests/native/test_win_probes.py`` (``pytest.mark.skipif(os.name
!= "nt")``). Only ``psutil`` and ``subprocess`` are imported at module level
(both cross-platform); ``winreg``, ``win32event``, ``win32security``,
``win32api``, and ``pywintypes`` are imported LAZILY inside each function
that needs them, per the house rule that ``import civiccast.native.*`` must
succeed on Linux even though these functions are only ever callable on
Windows.

Disclosed empirical corrections (found by exercising the real Win32 APIs on
the dev box, not assumed from documentation -- see
``evidence/dev-box-probes.md`` for the full narrative):

- ``CreateMutex`` on an object that already exists performs a full DACL
  check against the CALLING token, even for the process that originally
  created it (a second handle-open, not the creation itself, is what the
  DACL gates). An unprivileged (non-SYSTEM, non-Administrators-enabled)
  caller gets ``ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED`` (winerror 5) at ``CreateMutex`` time,
  not a ``WAIT_TIMEOUT`` from ``WaitForSingleObject`` -- both are real
  denials and both are classified as ``MutexStatus="denied"`` here (AC4's
  "an unprivileged token attempting to acquire ... is DENIED").
- A named kernel mutex is destroyed the instant its last open handle
  closes -- if the only process holding it crashes, the object is gone, not
  "abandoned," unless some other handle keeps it alive. The dev-box
  real-fire abandoned-mutex evidence therefore uses a three-actor pattern
  (a witness process that just holds a handle open, a holder that
  acquires-then-dies, and the reacquirer) with a test-only permissive SDDL
  -- the *classification logic* (WAIT_ABANDONED -> acquired_abandoned) is
  proven for real; exercising it against the PRODUCTION restrictive SDDL
  needs a privileged/elevated two-process run and is recorded as PENDING.
- ``ConvertSecurityDescriptorToStringSecurityDescriptor`` normalizes
  ``GENERIC_ALL`` ("GA") to the object-specific access mask
  (``0x1f0001`` for a mutex) on readback -- the literal substring "GA" from
  the SDDL used to *create* the object does not reappear when *reading* it
  back. Tests assert on the SID markers (``;;;SY)``, ``;;;BA)``, absence of
  ``;;;WD``) rather than the literal "GA" text.

    :func:`civiccast.native.pg_ctl_exec.run_captured_argv`.

    Why: these probes previously used ``subprocess.run(capture_output=True,

    (``wslhost.exe``) that inherit the pipe write-handles, and on Windows a

    ``guard.pre_child_start``/``evaluate_once``, so one hang blocks the
    supervisor's run loop AND its graceful-stop chain until the SCM stop
    itself times out. File-backed capture waits on the process handle only;
    the expiry kill-tree reaps the helpers too.

    Modeled closely on ``scan_run_entries``: ``users_root`` defaults to
    ``winreg.HKEY_USERS``; tests inject any root standing in for one or more
    "loaded hives". Uses the same ``_ERROR_NO_MORE_ITEMS`` (259) sentinel to
    distinguish clean end-of-enumeration from a genuine scan failure, and
    skips subkey names ending in ``"_Classes"`` for the same reason
    ``scan_run_entries`` does (those are the per-hive Classes shadow, never a
    real loaded-profile hive).

    Returns a TRI-STATE:
      * ``True`` -- ``WSL_DISTRO_NAME`` was found as the ``DistributionName``
        value of some ``{guid}`` subkey under some hive's Lxss key.

        HKEY_USERS scan, each hive's Lxss key open/enumerate, each
        ``{guid}`` subkey's DistributionName read) and none contained that
        distro name.
      * ``None`` -- the scan could not be trusted: the top-level HKEY_USERS
        enumeration itself failed, or opening/enumerating some hive's Lxss
        subtree (the Lxss key itself, a ``{guid}`` subkey, or its
        DistributionName value) failed with anything other than a clean
        not-found.

    Per this file's established convention (F6/F3), ``FileNotFoundError`` is
    the ONLY OSError that means readable absence -- a missing Lxss key under
    a hive (that hive simply has no WSL distros) or a ``{guid}`` subkey
    lacking a DistributionName value are both clean, expected absences and
    do not disqualify the scan. Every OTHER OSError (permission denied, a
    key vanishing mid-scan, ...) is untrusted and immediately downgrades the
    whole scan to ``None`` -- a scan that could not read everything it tried
    to read must never be reported as a confident ``False``.

    Where there is no registry at all (any non-Windows host -- CI's
    platform-independent lane runs this module on Linux), the answer is
    ``None`` for exactly the reason above: the scan could not be performed,
    so it cannot be reported as a confident ``False``. Raising
    ``ModuleNotFoundError`` out of a tri-state probe whose entire contract is
    "never fail loudly, downgrade to UNKNOWN" would be the one failure mode

    trustworthy inventory (nonzero exit, undecodable output, invocation
    error/timeout).

    Only a DEFINITE "no WSL service registered" (the confirmatory signal
    returning ``False``) downgrades the unknown into a genuine ``False``
    ("WSL is not installed on this machine -- no CivicCast distro can be
    registered because there is no WSL at all"). A service that IS present,
    or a service check that is itself ambiguous (``None``), both preserve the
    CC-WS4-001 fail-closed ``None`` -- a failed ``wsl.exe`` invocation is
    never trusted as "no WSL".

    The default classifier is resolved by name at call time (not bound as a
    default argument) so tests can monkeypatch the module attribute for the
    transitive ``probe_indistro_services`` path.

    CC-WS4-002: the SCM can only prove *WSL itself* exists or does not -- on
    a machine where WSL IS installed (SCM says present, or the SCM check is
    itself ambiguous) it has nothing to say about whether the CivicCast
    distro specifically is registered, which used to leave every such
    machine stuck at fail-closed ``None`` forever (confirmed live: under the

    LocalSystem -- where ``wsl.exe`` categorically refuses to run -- it read
    ``None``, and the guard never started the control plane). Fixed: on
    every path that does NOT already resolve to a definite ``False`` from
    the SCM signal, consult ``scan_registered_distros`` (the
    LocalSystem-safe registry inventory) before giving up. If the distro
    scan itself definitely proves the CivicCast distro is not registered
    (``False``), that is dispositive -- no CivicCast WSL runtime can be
    transmitting -- and this now returns ``False`` where it previously
    returned ``None``. If the distro scan returns ``True`` (distro IS
    registered; the failure is elsewhere) or ``None`` (the scan itself could
    not be trusted), the CC-WS4-001 fail-closed ``None`` is preserved exactly
    as before. The distro scanner is likewise resolved by name at call time
    (mirroring ``wsl_service_present``) so tests can drive it
    deterministically; the injectable ``distro_scanner`` keyword is additive
    and every existing positional call site (``_confirm_absence_via_service(

    Used both as A2's own "no distro registered" classification input and

    F1 fix: this used to fail-open -- a timeout or OSError silently became a
    definite ``False``, which meant "the probe couldn't run" was
    indistinguishable from "we confirmed no WSL install exists", and that
    unknown state authorized decide()'s D1 "absent + no WSL install =>

    TimeoutExpired/OSError/any other undecodable failure -- a ``False``
    result is now ONLY ever returned when ``wsl.exe -l -q`` actually ran and
    the CivicCast distro name is confirmed absent from its output.

    CC-WS4-001 fix (round 2, Critical): the F1 fix above only caught the
    *exception* path -- it still ignored ``CompletedProcess.returncode``
    entirely. A runner that RAN (no exception) but exited nonzero (e.g.
    ``wsl.exe -l -q`` returning "Access is denied") produced an
    empty/garbage stdout; ``WSL_DISTRO_NAME in output`` on that empty
    string is trivially ``False`` -- silently promoting a FAILED invocation
    into a CONFIRMED "no install" (the auditor's literal executed repro:
    A2's service query times out AND the confirmatory ``-l -q`` exits 1,
    which used to authorize ``decide()``'s selector-absent native-start
    row). Fixed: ``False`` is returned ONLY when returncode == 0 AND the
    decoded output contains no U+FFFD replacement character -- a clean
    decode under either UTF-16LE or UTF-8 is the positive "this was a
    trustworthy inventory" signal a garbled/binary byte stream fails under
    ``errors="replace"``. EVERY nonzero exit (regardless of what its stdout
    happens to contain -- even a distro name appearing in a failed
    invocation's echoed-back output is not trusted), timeout, invocation
    error, or undecodable output is an UNKNOWN inventory.

    CC-WS4-001 fix (round 3, Critical -- clean-machine cleanroom): on a
    genuinely WSL-less Windows box, ``wsl.exe`` is an OS inbox stub that
    exits NONZERO ("The Windows Subsystem for Linux is not installed"). The
    round-2 fix (correctly) refused to trust that nonzero exit as "no WSL",
    so it returned ``None`` -- but that fail-closed the dual-runtime guard
    and the native runtime never started on the very clean box it targets.
    Fixed WITHOUT reopening the fail-open: on every unknown-inventory path
    (nonzero exit, undecodable output, invocation error/timeout) the result
    is now routed through ``_confirm_absence_via_service`` -- a robust,
    non-localized WSL-SERVICE-presence signal read from the Service Control
    Manager (``sc query WslService`` / ``LxssManager``; see
    ``_default_wsl_service_present``). Only a DEFINITE "no WSL service
    registered" downgrades the unknown into a genuine ``False`` (WSL truly
    absent, native may start). A WSL service that IS present, or a service
    check that is itself ambiguous, both preserve the CC-WS4-001 ``None``.
    The exit-0 + clean-decode path is UNCHANGED and authoritative
    (``return WSL_DISTRO_NAME in output``) -- it never consults the service
    seam.

    CC-WS4-002: the supervisor runs as LocalSystem, and current WSL versions
    categorically refuse that identity -- ``wsl.exe -l -q`` exits -1 with
    "Running WSL as local system is not supported." -- so under LocalSystem
    this function NEVER takes the exit-0 authoritative path; it always falls
    through to ``_confirm_absence_via_service``. On a machine where WSL IS
    installed (but the CivicCast distro is not), the SCM signal alone could
    only prove WSL exists, never that the CivicCast distro specifically is
    absent, so this stayed a fail-closed ``None`` forever and the control
    plane never started (confirmed live: same call returns ``False`` under
    the interactive user, ``None`` under LocalSystem). Fixed by having
    ``_confirm_absence_via_service`` additionally consult
    ``scan_registered_distros`` -- a registry-backed, LocalSystem-safe distro
    inventory -- before giving up; see that function's docstring for the
    full discriminator logic. This function's own decision tree is
    otherwise unchanged: it still only ever calls
    ``_confirm_absence_via_service`` on the same three non-authoritative
    paths (exception, nonzero exit, undecodable output) it already did.

        safe ownership check GuardMonitor's real A3 callable must be wired
        to, NOT ``.acquire`` directly. The round-1 bug: every 30s
        re-evaluation called ``self._mutex()`` (bound to ``.acquire``),
        which always CreateMutex-opens and WaitForSingleObject-waits again,
        even when this same instance already owns the object -- an
        unelevated holder cannot reopen the production-DACL object it
        already owns (see the module docstring's first empirical
        correction: a second open performs a full DACL check against the
        calling token), so evaluation 2 spuriously observed a denial and
        the monitor controlled-stopped itself within one interval of
        starting.

        Fixed: if this instance currently owns the mutex (``self._owns``
        AND a live ``self._handle``), report stable self-ownership WITHOUT
        reopening or re-waiting the kernel object at all. Otherwise (the
        first-ever probe, OR a defensive case where ``self._owns`` was
        somehow left ``True`` with no live handle -- should not happen,
        ``release()`` always clears both together, but a genuine loss of
        ownership there is a genuine refusal, not something to paper over
        by trusting ``_owns`` alone) attempt exactly ONE real acquire. The
        exclusivity assertion against the other runtime therefore still
        happens exactly once, on the first probe -- not on every
