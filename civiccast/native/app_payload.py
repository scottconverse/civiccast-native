"""Policy core for the native Windows APPLICATION payload (`slice:ws5-installer`
WP-6 Part A).

The media runtime closure (`runtime_closure` / `runtime_manifest` /
`runtime_licenses`) makes the product's GStreamer/FFmpeg plumbing shippable.
This module is its sibling for the OTHER half a bootable install needs: the
CPython 3.12 interpreter the product runs on, the `civiccast` application, and
its hash-pinned third-party pip dependencies (the WP-5 app-payload finding,
`wp5-app-payload-finding.md`).

Same hard-won design as the closure, deliberately re-used rather than
re-invented:

* **Deny-by-default authorized distributions.** `AUTHORIZED_APP_DISTRIBUTIONS`
  is the exact reviewed set of pip distributions permitted into the payload. An
  unknown distribution FAILS the build even if its declared license looks fine
  (`runtime_closure.assert_authorized_distributions` proved this matters: a
  renamed/replaced/injected distribution is by construction absent from any
  denylist you thought to write down).
* **Per-distribution evidence-backed license, not the wheel's self-report as
  authority.** `APP_DISTRIBUTION_LICENSE` records the SPDX license this
  investigation confirmed for each authorized distribution (see the sweep in
  `.agent-runs/native-windows/ws5-installer/evidence/wp6-app-payload-design.md`).
  The build ALSO reads each installed wheel's own METADATA and refuses if that
  self-report names a prohibited (GPL/AGPL) license the map missed -- the wheel
  metadata is a cross-check INPUT, never the sole authority (spec-packaging-
  closure D3's stance, applied here).
* **Hard fail on GPL/AGPL/unknown/missing.** No waivers. LGPL is acceptable
  (psycopg 3 is LGPL-3.0-only) under the same posture the closure ships LGPL
  binaries with their texts; GPL/AGPL are refused.

Everything here is pure: no filesystem, no subprocess, no PE parsing. The build
script (`scripts/build_native_app_payload.py`) supplies the installed
distribution names and their live METADATA licenses; the tests supply
dictionaries. So the policy is provable without a ~150 MB staged interpreter.
