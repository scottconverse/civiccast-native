"""``civiccast runtime`` CLI verbs -- thin; logic lives in runtime_guard.py
(the decision table) and win_probes.py (the real probes). This module's own
job is orchestrating D7/D8's journal-backed phases and printing reports.

Platform note: this module's own top-level imports are Linux-safe (it
imports ``civiccast.native.win_probes``, which is itself Linux-import-safe
per that module's docstring). The CLI COMMANDS carry no explicit platform
gate -- ``tests/native/test_runtime_cli.py`` deliberately has no "win" in
its name and runs everywhere, because every registry/wsl/mutex interaction
is reached through the module-level probe bindings below
(``read_selector``, ``probe_keeper``, ...), which tests monkeypatch. A real,
unmocked invocation on non-Windows will surface a plain ``ModuleNotFoundError``
from the lazy ``import winreg`` inside win_probes.py -- acceptable, since
this whole package is Windows-only functionality; the CI/test
platform-independence contract is what matters here, not non-Windows UX
polish.

Dual CLI registration (disclosed in evidence/DESIGN-NOTES.md): this module
is registered BOTH as a `civiccast runtime <verb>` sub-app (via
``civiccast/cli.py``'s ``app.add_typer(runtime_app)``) AND as its own
``civiccast-runtime`` console script (`[project.scripts]` in
pyproject.toml) -- satisfying spec D7/D8's literal `civiccast-runtime
cutover-to-native` invocation AND ADR-0005's umbrella-CLI convention.
``--civiccast-runtime-host`` (the Rust installer's keepalive flag) is an
unrelated legacy surface -- name-distinct from `civiccast-runtime` on
purpose, not a typo.

    Administrator, who could read the key with ``reg query`` regardless. It
    mints nothing, writes nothing, changes no ACL, adds no static token, and
    opens no unauthenticated endpoint. A non-elevated caller gets a named
    "run this elevated" refusal and no nonce.

# CC-WS4-003 (round 2, Critical): the D7a maintenance/freeze interlock
# bracket. `cutover-to-native` and `rollback-to-wsl` both mutate the
# selector -- both now run INSIDE the interlock rather than outside it.
#
# Two modes, chosen by whether `--interlock-owner`/`--interlock-generation`
# are supplied:
#   OWNED (default, no --interlock-owner): the command TAKES and HOLDS the
#     interlock itself for the whole transaction (fresh owner_run_id = the
#     journal's own run_id, a fresh generation via take_interlock's own
#     increment). Released on full success; on ANY failure it is LEFT HELD
#     and journaled, so a resume continues inside the SAME bracket -- a
#     half-done cutover stays frozen, which is the safe direction.
#   EXTERNAL (--interlock-owner + --interlock-generation both supplied,
#     the migration case -- migration takes the freeze FIRST per migration
#     D1): the command does NOT take its own interlock. It CONTINUOUSLY
#     re-verifies, before every phase and again immediately after the
#     selector-mutating phase, that a held record still exists bound to
#     that exact owner_run_id + generation. Free, released, unreadable,
#     wrong-owner, or generation-drift aborts BEFORE any further selector
#     mutation -- this command never releases an EXTERNAL-mode interlock
#     (the migration tooling that took it owns that decision).
#
# The bound owner_run_id/generation are recorded on the journal itself
# (CutoverJournal.interlock_owner_run_id/interlock_generation) so a resume
# knows which record it must keep re-verifying against, in either mode.

    ``interlock_owner``): this command takes and holds the interlock itself
    for the whole transaction, releasing it only on full success; any
    failure leaves it held so a resume continues inside the same bracket.

    it continuously re-verifies the caller-owned held record before every
