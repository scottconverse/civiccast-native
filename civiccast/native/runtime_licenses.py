"""Per-FILE license provenance for the native Windows runtime closure.

`spec-packaging-closure` D3: "`gst-inspect` license metadata is an INPUT,
not the authority -- each plugin's license is confirmed against upstream
source license files for the exact version." This module is the result of
that confirmation, not a restatement of the wheels' own aggregate `License`
classifier (which covers the WHOLE wheel; we ship a pruned subset of each
one, so the aggregate is an upper bound, never our bill of materials).

Full investigation, exact commands, and verbatim output live in
`.agent-runs/native-windows/ws5-packaging-closure/evidence/
license-provenance.md`. Read that file for the evidence behind every entry
below; this module only encodes the conclusions.

Deliberately independent of `runtime_manifest.py` (another worker owns that
file concurrently as of this writing) -- nothing here imports from it, and
nothing in `runtime_manifest.py` imports from here yet. `classify_shipped_
file` is written to be a drop-in per-path license resolver for whoever wires
this in next.

AC7 is the design constraint throughout: `classify_shipped_file` returns
`None` for anything this investigation did not confirm -- never a guessed
default, never falling back to the loosest or the strictest license in the
table. A `None` result is a provenance gap, not a "probably fine".

#: `fontconfig-1.dll` (bin/) and its typelib counterpart are the one
#: genuine "we could not confirm this with the same rigor as everything
#: else" gap this investigation found. fontconfig has no runtime
#: license-query API (unlike GStreamer plugins or FFmpeg), and its
#: upstream license text is not a registered SPDX identifier this
#: investigation could match with confidence. Named explicitly per AC7
#: rather than silently guessed. See evidence memo "Unresolved" section.
#: RESOLVED 2026-07-23, so this set is now empty -- kept (rather than deleted)
#: because it is the mechanism AC7 depends on: any future file whose provenance
#: cannot be confirmed goes in here and halts the build, and an empty set is a
#: statement that there are currently none, not that the concept was dropped.
#:
#: fontconfig was the one open case. Resolved with real evidence rather than a
#: guess: the shipped binary self-identifies as fontconfig 2.16.1 (debug path
#: `fontconfig-2.16.1\\b\\src\\fontconfig-1.pdb` embedded in the DLL), and
#: upstream's COPYING for that project reads "Permission to use, copy, modify,
#: distribute, and SELL this software and its documentation for any purpose is
#: hereby granted without fee ... and that the name of the author(s) not be used
#: in advertising or publicity". The "and sell" grant plus the no-advertising
#: clause is precisely SPDX `HPND-sell-variant` -- permissive, and categorically
#: neither GPL nor LGPL. It ships because it is genuinely required: cairo-2.dll,
#: pangocairo-1.0-0.dll and pangoft2-1.0-0.dll all import it (verified against
#: the built tree), so it cannot simply be pruned.

# Category 7 -- the native-ffmpeg-runtime pack (the FFmpeg COMMAND-LINE tools,
# `scripts/build_native_ffmpeg_pack.py`)
#
# Distinct from Category 2's `SUPPORT_LIBRARY_LICENSE`, which covers the
# `avcodec-61.dll`/`avutil-59.dll`/... family the PyAV/GStreamer WHEELS ship
# inside the app-payload media closure. This pack ships a DIFFERENT upstream
# artifact entirely: BtbN's `win64-lgpl-shared` FFmpeg build, whose libraries
# carry different soname majors (`avcodec-62.dll`, `avutil-60.dll`, ...) AND a
# different license (LGPL-3.0-or-later, because that build is configured
# `--enable-version3`; the wheels' build is not). A shared basename table
# across the two would therefore be actively wrong, not merely untidy -- the
# same reasoning Category 6's header already gives for keeping the server
# pack's namespace separate.
#
# EVIDENCE, per file, from the binaries themselves rather than from the
# upstream project's reputation:
#
#   * `ffmpeg.exe -L` / `ffprobe.exe -L` (run against the exact extracted,
#     hash-verified archive this builder packs) print, verbatim: "ffmpeg is
#     free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms
#     of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free
#     Software Foundation; either version 3 of the License, or (at your
#     option) any later version." That is the binaries' OWN self-report of
#     LGPL-3.0-or-later.
#   * The same binaries' `-version` configuration string carries
#     `--enable-version3` and carries NEITHER `--enable-gpl` NOR
#     `--enable-nonfree`, and explicitly disables every GPL-only external
#     encoder the build could otherwise have linked (`--disable-libx264
#     --disable-libx265 --disable-libxvid --disable-libxavs2
#     --disable-libdavs2 --disable-librubberband --disable-libvidstab
#     --disable-frei0r --disable-avisynth`) plus the nonfree
#     `--disable-libfdk-aac`. A GPL branch in this artifact is therefore
#     excluded by the build configuration itself, not merely by the filename
#     of the archive.
#   * `native-windows-runtime-dependencies.lock.json`'s `ffmpeg` artifact
#     independently records `spdx_license: "LGPL-3.0-or-later"` for the SAME
#     hash-pinned archive -- a reviewed second source agreeing with the
#     binaries' self-report.
#
# The av*/sw* libraries and the two executables all come out of that single
# `--enable-version3` FFmpeg build tree and are covered by the one LGPL-3.0
# text the archive itself ships (packed here as
# `licenses/ffmpeg/LICENSE.txt`), so they share one identifier.
#
# SCOPE NOTE, recorded rather than papered over (the same honesty posture
# `build_native_runtime_closure.render_license_notices_readme`'s "What this
# directory is NOT" section takes): the identifier below governs the FFmpeg
# code in these files. That build also STATICALLY links a number of external
# libraries under their own licenses (libopenh264, libaom, libopus, libvpx,
# libmp3lame, libwebp, ... -- the complete enabled set is enumerated verbatim
# in the binaries' own `-version` configuration string, which the pack's
# generated NOTICE reproduces). BtbN's archive ships no per-dependency license
# texts of its own, so this pack does not claim per-dependency provenance it
# does not have; it names the gap in the NOTICE instead. Establishing the full
# static-dependency BOM for this artifact is tracked work, not something this
# table silently asserts.

# Category 8 -- the native-cuda-runtime pack (cuBLAS + cuDNN Windows runtime
# DLLs, `scripts/build_native_cuda_pack.py`)
#
# Owner ruling (Scott Converse, 2026-08-15): capable stations get GPU caption
# acceleration -- `station_runtime.resolve_cuda_bin_dir`'s presence gate
# already ships (a prior work package), but nothing built the pack it looks
# for. This pack is that builder: it downloads the pinned
# `nvidia-cublas-cu12`/`nvidia-cudnn-cu12` PyPI wheels (the SAME wheels a
# `pip install torch`-style CUDA setup would pull) and repacks the two
# wheels' own `nvidia/cublas/bin/`/`nvidia/cudnn/bin/` DLL trees, flattened,
# as the signed `native-cuda-runtime` component.
#
# Distinct from every other category here: neither cuBLAS nor cuDNN is open
# source. Both are proprietary NVIDIA binaries distributed under NVIDIA's own
# end-user license agreements (the CUDA Toolkit EULA for cuBLAS, the cuDNN
# Supplement to that EULA for cuDNN) -- not an SPDX-registered open-source
# identifier. Recorded here as `LicenseRef-*` (SPDX's own convention for a
# license with no registered identifier) so `classify_cuda_pack_file` still
# gives AC7 a confirmed, evidence-backed answer instead of leaving every
# shipped DLL an unresolved provenance gap.
#
# BASENAME-PREFIX rule, not an exact per-file table like
# `FFMPEG_PACK_BASENAME_LICENSE`'s derived nine-file closure: this pack ships
# EVERY DLL the pinned wheels carry under their `bin/` directories (the
# builder's own doc comment: "extracts every DLL", not a minimized PE-import
# closure), so the exact shipped filename SET is only known from the real
# wheels at real build time -- re-pinning a wheel version can add or drop a
# file this table would otherwise need editing to keep up with, silently. A
# prefix rule is the evidence-backed answer for both families instead:
# NVIDIA's own DLL naming convention names every cuBLAS runtime file
# `cublas*` (`cublas64_12.dll`, `cublasLt64_12.dll`, ...) -- plus the nvBLAS
# drop-in `nvblas*` (`nvblas64_12.dll`), shipped in the SAME cuBLAS wheel under
# the SAME CUDA Toolkit EULA, so it is a third recognized prefix, not a third
# license -- and every cuDNN
# runtime file `cudnn*` (`cudnn64_9.dll`, `cudnn_ops64_9.dll`,
# `cudnn_cnn64_9.dll`, `cudnn_adv64_9.dll`, `cudnn_graph64_9.dll`,
# `cudnn_heuristic64_9.dll`, `cudnn_engines_precompiled64_9.dll`,
# `cudnn_engines_runtime_compiled64_9.dll`, ...) -- confirmed against both
# wheels' published file listings at review time. A file that matches
# NONE of these prefixes is exactly what AC7 exists to catch: something this
# investigation did not confirm, and `classify_cuda_pack_file` returns `None`
# for it rather than guessing (the builder's own
# `_require_full_license_provenance` gate refuses the build on that `None`,
# the same fail-closed posture Category 6/7's guards already take).
