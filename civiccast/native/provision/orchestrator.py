"""The journaled PostgreSQL/NATS provisioning sequence.

This module is PURE ORCHESTRATION over the injected
:class:`~civiccast.native.provision.models.ProvisionSeams`, mirroring
:mod:`civiccast.native.upgrade.orchestrator`'s design: it never touches
Windows, ``initdb``, ``pg_ctl``, or ``nats-server`` itself -- every real
action is a seam. That is what lets a fake-seam test exercise the REAL state
machine (the same code that runs in production), rather than a
re-implementation of it.

Forward sequence:

  1. verify the server-binaries pack               -> PACK_VERIFIED
  2. detect/initdb the PostgreSQL data directory    -> POSTGRES_CLUSTER_READY
  3. write postgresql.conf + pg_hba.conf            -> POSTGRES_CONFIG_WRITTEN
  4. detect/create the "civiccast" database         -> DATABASE_READY (BLOCKER #52)
  5. detect/create the NATS JetStream store dir     -> NATS_STORE_READY
  6. write the nats-server config                   -> NATS_CONFIG_WRITTEN
  7. done                                            -> COMPLETE

Failure handling (deliberately simpler than the D3 upgrade engine's: a fresh
provisioning run has no prior installed state to roll back TO -- see
:class:`~civiccast.native.provision.models.ProvisionPhase`'s docstring):

* ANY step failure -- including a pack-verification refusal, a
  version-mismatch fail-closed refusal, or an NATS-store-path-is-not-a-
  directory refusal -- halts the run at ``FAILED``. The journal and an
  operator recovery document are preserved; nothing is auto-repaired.
* A rerun of :func:`run_provision` over a journal already at ``FAILED``
  returns that terminal outcome UNCHANGED -- it never silently retries.
  This is deliberate fail-closed behavior (WS5 task instruction: "fail-loud
  on any unexpected state, never silently repair"); an operator must
  investigate before a fresh run is attempted (typically over a fresh
  ``state_root``, or after clearing the specific blocking condition named in
  the recovery document).
* A rerun over a journal already at ``COMPLETE`` returns that outcome
  unchanged without touching anything -- provisioning is idempotent at the
  whole-run level, not just per-step.

Resume (idempotent): :func:`run_provision` reads any existing non-terminal
journal for the context and continues from its recorded boundary. Because the
on-disk phase only advances AFTER its real action succeeds and is persisted,
a kill at any boundary leaves a journal the resume can drive to a clean
COMPLETE or a clean FAILED halt. Each forward step is individually idempotent
(the POSTGRES_CLUSTER_READY, DATABASE_READY, and NATS_STORE_READY steps
explicitly detect and reuse existing state rather than re-running initdb /
re-creating an existing database / recreating the store directory), so
re-running a step whose effect already landed is safe.

    BEFORE ``POSTGRES_CLUSTER_READY`` (nothing has touched ``initdb`` yet, so
