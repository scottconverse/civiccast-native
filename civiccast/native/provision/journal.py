"""Durable, power-loss-resilient persistence for the provisioning journal.

Same persistence contract as :mod:`civiccast.native.upgrade.journal` (that
module's docstring, verbatim rationale, applies here unchanged):

* **Atomic writes.** Every persist writes a sibling temp file, fsyncs it, and
  ``os.replace``\\s it over the real journal, so a power loss during a write
  leaves EITHER the old complete journal OR the new complete journal on disk
  -- never a half-written one.
* **Fail-loud load.** The journal is parsed through
  :class:`~civiccast.native.provision.models.ProvisionJournal`
  (``extra="forbid"``); a truncated, schema-drifted, or hand-edited journal
  raises :class:`JournalError` instead of resuming from a value we cannot
  trust.

The journal file lives under the provisioning state root (ProgramData), so a
resuming process can find it regardless of what happened to the data
directories it describes.

SECURITY (municipal-shared-PC fix, 2026-07-30): two things :func:`write_journal`
does that the ORIGINAL version of this module did not --

1. **Never persists the plaintext database password.** An audit,
   independently re-verified with measured ACLs on a real Windows 11 box,
   found ``ProvisionContext.database_password`` written verbatim into this
   JSON file, which -- see point 2 -- was itself sitting in a
   world-readable directory. By inspection of every consumer of a LOADED
   journal (:mod:`civiccast.native.provision.orchestrator`,
   :func:`civiccast.native.provision.__main__.main`): nothing ever reads
   ``journal.context.database_password`` back from an on-disk journal for
   real work. The orchestrator's resume path
   (:func:`~civiccast.native.provision.orchestrator.run_provision`) never
   references it; the only two live readers of ``context.database_password``
   are (a) the ``run_initdb`` seam, which closes over the ``context`` object
   built FRESH in the CURRENT process's ``main()`` invocation (a NEW
   password every run, never the journal's persisted one), and (b)
   :func:`civiccast.native.provision.models.resolve_database_url`, called
   with that SAME fresh, never-reloaded ``context``. There is therefore no
   resume path that needs the persisted value -- it is written to
   ``payload_dict`` here as :data:`_REDACTED_DATABASE_PASSWORD_MARKER`
   instead of ``journal.context.database_password``, which is otherwise
   left untouched in memory (the caller's own copy is unaffected; only the
   on-disk serialization is redacted).
2. **Hardens the state root's own DACL** to SYSTEM + Administrators,
   inheritance disabled -- see :func:`_harden_state_root_acl`.

#: Non-empty so it still satisfies :class:`ProvisionContext`'s own

#: carry a usable password (nothing needs it to).

#: SYSTEM + Administrators full control, PLUS the CURRENT process's own user

#: this is a format template, not the final SDDL string). Inheritable to
#: files/subdirectories created inside the hardened directory (``OICI``),
#: PROTECTED (``P``) so ProgramData's inherited, world-readable default DACL
#: -- measured on a real Windows 11 box: ``BUILTIN\\Users`` has
#: ``ReadAndExecute`` on ``C:\\ProgramData`` -- cannot flow back onto this
#: directory on a future create/reboot/GPO refresh.
#:
#: WHY THE CALLER'S OWN SID, not just SYSTEM+Administrators (disclosed
#: empirical correction, found by exercising this against the real ACL on
#: this dev box, the same "measure it, don't assume it" rule
#: ``civiccast.native.win_probes``'s module docstring already follows):
#: hardening to ONLY SYSTEM+Administrators, with no ACE for the account that
#: actually creates the directory, locks that SAME PROCESS out of its own
#: state root the moment its token does not have ``BUILTIN\\Administrators``
#: ENABLED -- which is exactly the case for an ordinary (non-elevated, or a
#: UAC-split non-admin) token, even though that token is the OWNER of the
#: directory it just created. Unlike a registry key's ``WRITE_DAC``/
#: ``READ_CONTROL`` (which an owner keeps implicitly, see
#: ``native_service_registration.rs``'s own equivalent test), ORDINARY DATA
#: access (reading/writing files inside the directory on a SUBSEQUENT,
#: freshly-opened handle) is NOT an owner-implicit right -- confirmed by
#: this exact failure mode the first cut of this fix hit live: a second
#: ``write_journal`` call (a later provisioning phase, same process) failed
#: ``PermissionError: [Errno 13]`` trying to create its own temp file inside
#: the directory it had just hardened one call earlier. Including the
#: caller's own SID reproduces what Windows's OWN default DACL already does
#: for a freshly created object (creator's SID present alongside
#: inherited entries) while still REMOVING the one ACE that matters for the
#: shared-station threat model (``BUILTIN\\Users``, which admits every OTHER
#: local account too, not just this one).

    Windows-only; a no-op on any other platform so this module keeps
    importing (and its pure logic keeps being testable) on Linux, per the
    house rule documented in
    :mod:`civiccast.native.win_probes`'s module docstring ("``import
    civiccast.native.*`` must succeed on Linux even though these functions
    are only ever callable on Windows") -- ``pywin32`` is imported LAZILY

    Called on EVERY :func:`write_journal` (idempotent/self-healing, not just
    first creation) and deliberately FAIL-LOUD: this engine's own stated
    convention is "fail-loud on any unexpected state, never silently
    repair" (:mod:`civiccast.native.provision.orchestrator`'s module
    docstring), and a hardening failure here means the journal -- which,
    even with the password redacted, still carries the plan/context/history
    and the recovery document -- is about to be written into a directory
    this call could not actually secure. Silently continuing would leave
    that state readable by any other local user on a shared station without
    telling anyone. In production this call always runs from an ALREADY
    elevated process (the NSIS installer, or the provisioning CLI it spawns
    -- see ``native_service_registration.rs``'s module doc), so a real
    failure here is itself a signal something is wrong with the
    installation, not routine. A NON-elevated invocation (e.g. an operator
    running the repair CLI directly, without elevation, against a
    brand-new state root) is still able to harden its OWN freshly-created
    directory -- ``WRITE_DAC`` on a just-created object is an
    owner-implicit right regardless of elevation tier -- so this does not
    itself require admin; what requires elevation is the SAME token later
    needing to read/write OTHER accounts' or SYSTEM's already-hardened
    state, which is a separate, correctly-loud ``PermissionError`` rather
    than a silent no-op.
