"""CLI entry point the native NSIS hook set invokes for live PostgreSQL
provisioning execution (WP2 provision-execution wiring;
``native_service_registration.rs``'s module doc's "DatabaseUrl" STOP section
names this as the missing caller). Mirrors
:mod:`civiccast.native.upgrade.__main__`'s CLI shape: all the logic lives in
the tested engine (:mod:`civiccast.native.provision`), never here. This
module's own job is narrow: generate the database credential, decide whether
a run is even needed (idempotency), assemble the plan/context, drive the
engine against its REAL seam bundle, and hand the resolved ``DatabaseUrl``
back to the Rust caller through a single stdout marker line -- never through
a log, a journal entry, an NSIS variable dump, or this process's own
diagnostic output.

NATS JetStream was removed from the product entirely (owner decision
2026-08-20, ADR 0023 "NATS removed -- in-process event bus", which
supersedes ADR 0001); this CLI no longer accepts NATS flags or resolves NATS
paths.

Invocation (``nsis-hooks-native.nsh``'s ``NSIS_HOOK_POSTINSTALL``)::

    python -m civiccast.native.provision \\
        --install-root "C:\\Program Files\\CivicCast (Native)" \\
        --owner-run-id <run-id> \\
        --pack-signing-key-id <id> --pack-public-key-base64 <base64> \\
        --pack-product-version <v> --pack-compatible-core <v> \\
        [--existing-database-url <value-or-empty>]

Every other flag (``--program-data-root``, ``--server-pack-path``,
``--initdb-path``, hosts/ports, database name/username, PostgreSQL major
version) has a derived or product default (:func:`resolve_provision_paths`)
and exists mainly so tests can override it without touching a real
filesystem layout.

Password handling (credential-sensitive, read this before changing anything
here):

* The password is generated ONLY on the fresh-provisioning path
  (:data:`ProvisionCliAction.RUN`) -- never on a no-op or fail-loud path,
  and never twice for the same cluster.
* It is placed into exactly ONE output surface this process controls: the
  single ``CIVICCAST_DATABASE_URL=...`` line printed to stdout
  (:func:`format_handoff_line`). Every other write this module performs
  (``sys.stderr.write`` progress lines) is static text or a phase name --
  never the password or a URL containing it. Grepping this file for
  ``print(`` finds exactly ONE call site: the DatabaseUrl handoff line. (The
  installer-handoff setup nonce that used to travel the same way was retired
  2026-08-29 -- owner decision -- once the control plane's loopback-only bind
  made it a redundant gate; see ``civiccast.installer.router.
  _require_local_setup_request``.)
* ``civiccast.native.provision.orchestrator`` never writes the password into
  a journal history entry, the recovery document, or a log line -- verified
  by inspection: every ``_persist``/``_halt`` call's ``detail`` string is
  static or built from ``PostgresClusterDecision``/``DatabaseDecision``
  text, which never reference ``context.database_password``.
* CORRECTED 2026-07-30 (municipal-shared-PC hardening fix; the previous
  revision of this bullet claimed the password's on-disk persistence in
  ``ProvisionJournal.context`` was a deliberate, load-bearing design decision
  "needed so a KILLED run resumed by a NEW process can still resolve the
  final ``DatabaseUrl`` on completion" -- an independently re-verified audit
  found the journal directory was NOT actually ACL'd as that claim assumed,
  and by-inspection re-checking of the resume path shows the claim's own
  JUSTIFICATION was also wrong: no resume path ever reads
  ``journal.context.database_password`` back. ``run_provision``'s resume
  branch (``orchestrator._drive_forward(existing, seams)``) drives the
  LOADED journal's phase forward using ``seams`` built in THIS invocation of
  ``main()`` from a FRESHLY generated password (line ~414 below), not the
  journal's persisted one; and this file's own final
  ``resolve_database_url(plan=plan, context=context)`` call (line ~427)
  uses that same fresh, never-reloaded ``context`` too -- never
  ``outcome.journal.context``. The persisted value was therefore dead data
  with a false justification.
  ``civiccast.native.provision.journal.write_journal`` now redacts
  ``context.database_password`` to a fixed, non-secret marker before
  writing the journal to disk (the in-memory object this process holds is
  untouched) and additionally hardens the state root directory's own DACL
  to SYSTEM + Administrators -- see that module's docstring.
* The Rust caller (``native_service_registration::run_native_provision``)
  captures this process's stdout/stderr WITHOUT ever printing it, parses the
  one handoff line, and writes the value straight to
  ``HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\CivicCast\\Native\\DatabaseUrl`` via the existing
  ``write_database_url`` (in-process function call, not a second CLI
  subprocess -- so the password never appears on a second process's argv
  either).

    N-15: the last row USED to be ``FAIL_LOUD_MISSING_REGISTRY`` -- but a
    surviving cluster with no registry value and no in-flight journal is the
    exact, expected state uninstall leaves behind: chain M / security fix F-02
    deletes the ``DatabaseUrl`` credential while PRESERVING the product data
    directory (so the credential lives nowhere and cannot be reconstructed),
    yet the installer already promises the operator that "your recorded data
    and database are preserved by uninstall and will be adopted by the new
    installation". Refusing here broke that promise on every
    uninstall-then-reinstall. ``ADOPT_EXISTING`` keeps it: the CLI
    re-establishes a FRESH credential on the SAME cluster (no initdb, no
    database drop -- station data preserved) via
    :func:`~civiccast.native.provision.seams.reset_cluster_credential`, whose
    own LIVE ownership check fails loud
    (:class:`~civiccast.native.provision.seams.AdoptionForeignClusterError` ->
    :func:`~civiccast.native.provision.orchestrator.halt_adopt_foreign_cluster`)
    on a cluster the product did not create -- so "never touch a foreign
    cluster" is preserved, moved to where it can be verified against the live
    cluster instead of guessed offline. ``FAIL_LOUD_MISSING_REGISTRY`` remains
    as the label that foreign-cluster refusal is reported under.

    On a re-install over an existing cluster, the registry's ``DatabaseUrl``
    is the SOURCE OF TRUTH (task instruction): reusing it means the CLI never
    regenerates a password it cannot re-derive, and never re-runs ``initdb``
    over a cluster the orchestrator's own idempotency logic would refuse to
    touch anyway.

    Task #55 (audit-lite FINDING-003): a cluster with NO registry value is
    NOT automatically "an unrelated, previously-successful cluster needing a
    repair install" -- it is exactly what an INTERRUPTED provisioning run
    also leaves behind (``initdb`` at ``POSTGRES_CLUSTER_READY`` succeeded,
    but the run was killed -- process kill, power loss, AV interference,
    a Sandbox timeout -- before ever reaching the end and handing off
    ``DatabaseUrl`` to the Rust caller). :func:`probe_resumable_journal`
    distinguishes the two: a present, non-terminal
    (:class:`~civiccast.native.provision.models.ProvisionPhase`) journal at
    this ``state_root`` is proof a run is genuinely IN PROGRESS, not that
    this is a foreign cluster -- that case now resumes via
    :func:`~civiccast.native.provision.orchestrator.run_provision`'s own
    idempotent journal-replay (each forward step re-detects and reuses
    already-landed state) instead of being misdirected to
    ``FAIL_LOUD_MISSING_REGISTRY``. A cluster with NO registry value AND no
    resumable journal is still not a case this CLI may guess its way out of
    -- it surfaces as a fail-loud condition requiring operator repair (D5's
    territory), never a silent regenerate-and-hope.

    Task #57 (disclosed in commit abdba55b): resuming is only SAFE while the
    journal is still BEFORE ``POSTGRES_CLUSTER_READY`` -- at or past that
    phase, ``initdb --pwfile`` already baked a real credential into the
    cluster, and the RUN branch would drive forward with a FRESHLY generated
    (therefore different, and never reconciled) password
    (:func:`probe_credential_lost_journal` detects this, distinct from
    :func:`probe_resumable_journal`). ``FAIL_LOUD_CREDENTIAL_LOST`` halts
    that case instead of silently misdirecting it into the RUN branch --
    see :func:`~civiccast.native.provision.orchestrator.

    :func:`civiccast.native.supervisor.children.default_egress_work_dir` and
    :data:`civiccast.native.supervisor.service.DEFAULT_LOG_ROOT` already
    use). String-built, not ``pathlib.Path``, for the same reason
    ``default_egress_work_dir`` gives: the Windows-style backslash path must
    be identical regardless of the host OS running this pure module's tests.

    PostgreSQL data lives under the ``<program_data_root>\\CivicCast\\data``
    tree (alongside the existing egress work dir at ``...\\data\\egress``),
    so a single ACL boundary covers all of it. ``postgresql.conf``/
    ``pg_hba.conf`` MUST live INSIDE
    ``postgres_data_dir`` -- not a style choice: ``postgres_child_spec`` in
    :mod:`civiccast.native.supervisor.children` launches ``pg_ctl start -D
    <data_dir> -w`` with no ``-c config_file=`` override, so PostgreSQL only
    ever reads its default ``$PGDATA/postgresql.conf``/``$PGDATA/pg_hba.conf``
    locations; writing the provisioned config anywhere else would be
    silently ignored by the real server.

    ``server_pack_path``/``initdb_path`` default to a
    ``packs\\native-server-binaries\\`` convention under ``install_root`` --
    a CODER DECISION, not a spec-pinned value: no earlier work package
    established where an extracted server-binaries pack lands on disk (the
    existing component-pack acquisition flow, ``--civiccast-acquire-channel``
    / ``--civiccast-import-station``, is an operator/cache-root-driven step
    with no fixed staged-directory convention of its own yet -- see
    ``nsis-hooks-native.nsh``'s own comment on this). Documented here and in
    the WP2 evidence file so a later work package that establishes a
    different pack-staging convention has one place to change it; both
    parameters remain overridable for exactly that reason.

# N-16 (fleet-tester candidate 99db2c6, soak/INSTALL-FAILED.md /
# soak/evidence-provision-failure/): adopted-journal staleness.
#
# Uninstall preserves ProgramData -- including this CLI's own provisioning
# journal -- by design (see ProvisionCliAction.ADOPT_EXISTING's N-15 doc).
# That is correct for the journal's DATA-lifecycle fields (nothing here ever
# re-derives ``postgres_data_dir``/``postgres_config_path``/
# ``postgres_hba_path``, all of which live under ``program_data_root`` and
# stay fixed regardless of where the product's OWN files are installed). It
# is WRONG for ``context.server_pack_path``: that is the one journal field
# derived from ``install_root`` (Program Files, or wherever ``/D=`` pointed a
# given run), and a later install to a DIFFERENT ``install_root`` over the
# SAME preserved ProgramData leaves the adopted journal naming a pack path
# under the OLD location -- which no longer exists once the candidate lives
# somewhere else. Nothing downstream re-validated that path against THIS
# run's install root before trusting it: a TERMINAL (COMPLETE/FAILED) journal
# short-circuits ``run_provision`` without ever touching a seam at all (see
# that function's own docstring -- "left alone on rerun"), and even a
# non-terminal one would drive the recorded (stale) path forward.
#
# Live-diagnosed (read-only, not reproduced against real files -- see
# soak/INSTALL-FAILED.md's own "no preserved data or candidate files were
# modified to test that inference" caveat) on candidate 99db2c6: a fresh
# install to ``C:\CivicCastHostStore\install`` after an uninstall that
# preserved ``C:\ProgramData\CivicCast`` adopted a 2026-08-16 journal whose
# ``server_pack_path`` still named
# ``C:\Program Files\CivicCast (Native)\packs\native-server-binaries.ccpack``
# -- a path Program Files no longer had (only a residual ``uninstall.exe``
# was left there), while the real candidate pack sat under the NEW install
# root instead. Provisioning returned rc 75.
