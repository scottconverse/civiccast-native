"""The supervisor's state vocabulary and its pure, total transition function.

This is the correctness core of the slice: no I/O, no Windows imports, no
process handles -- just ``(state, event) -> state`` and a few D5/D6 predicates,
so every claim about the supervisor's control logic is checkable in CI on any
OS (spec build-step 1: "child state machine (pure, CI-tested)").

Seven states (owner-approved deviation, 2026-07-20).
--------------------------------------------------
Spec ``spec-supervisor.md`` D6 enumerates FIVE states: ``starting / ready /
degraded / blocked_wsl_active / stopping``. This module carries SEVEN -- the
five plus two that other, already-merged specs mandate but D6's enum omits.
The addition is disclosed, not silent (specs/README ladder: surface, don't
diverge), and was surfaced for and received owner approval:

* ``blocked_probe_unavailable`` -- mandated by the dual-runtime guard (WS4,
  ``spec-dual-runtime-guard`` D3/AC9) and already the ``state_name`` the merged
  ``runtime_guard`` emits when a probe cannot be trusted. The supervisor must
  be able to *hold* that state, so it must be in the enum.
* ``maintenance`` -- the installer/migration read-only health mode
  (``spec-installer-lifecycle`` D3 / ``spec-migration`` D1): while the D7a
  maintenance interlock is HELD, bring up Postgres + NATS + control plane in a
  read-only posture and start NO media workers, leaving only when the interlock
  frees. D6's five states had nowhere to put this.

The two blocked-state string values are IDENTICAL to the guard's
``GuardDecision.state_name`` vocabulary, so a guard decision maps onto a
supervisor state with no translation table.

Event alphabet (a WS5 modeling choice, disclosed).
--------------------------------------------------
D6 defines the states and the readiness/dependency *semantics* but does not
enumerate a formal event alphabet -- that is an implementation choice. The
events below are the complete set of inputs that move the supervisor, each
traceable to a spec obligation (guard decisions -> D9/D3; interlock -> D7a;
restart storm -> D5; readiness/dependency -> D6; stop -> service SvcStop).
``supervisor_transition`` is TOTAL over the (state x event) product -- proven by
the P1 exhaustive-product test.

Precedence (design Sec.1): ``maintenance`` > ``blocked_*`` > ``degraded``.
Because the machine consumes one event at a time, precedence is encoded as
ordered guards: a higher-priority condition's event overrides regardless of the
lower-priority state it interrupts, and while the higher-priority state holds,
lower-priority events are ignored until it clears.

Maintenance exit carries a fresh guard verdict (WS5-RAT-002).
--------------------------------------------------------------
Leaving ``maintenance`` is the one transition that must NOT trust event
ordering. A ``guard_block_*`` that arrives while the interlock is HELD is
correctly ignored -- the freeze holds and nothing transmits in maintenance --
but that block must not be *erased* when the interlock frees. So the
interlock-release signal is not a bare event: it CARRIES the guard decision as
one of three composite events. ``core.py`` re-evaluates the guard synchronously
at the held->freed edge and emits exactly one of ``interlock_freed_clear`` /
``interlock_freed_blocked_wsl`` / ``interlock_freed_blocked_probe``. Only a
clear verdict reaches ``starting`` (a writer-capable state); a WSL-active or
probe-unavailable verdict routes straight to the matching blocked state. There
is therefore no path out of maintenance toward a transmitting state without a
current, positive guard authorization -- the fail-open the ratification found.

Four properties the tests pin (spec build-step 1):
* **P1 totality** -- every (state, event) yields a valid state.
* **P2 maintenance never starts workers** -- ``workers_permitted("maintenance")``
  is False (as it is for every non-serving state).
* **P3 dependent restart ordering** -- a child is restart-eligible only after
  ALL its D6 predecessors are ``ready`` (D6: "a controlled restart AFTER the
  dependency re-enters ready").
* **P4 no blocked -> ready shortcut** -- from either blocked state, no event
  reaches ``ready`` directly; release goes ``blocked_* --guard_clear-->
  starting --children_ready--> ready``, so readiness is always re-proven.
