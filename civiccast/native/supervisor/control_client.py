r"""CC-WS5-007 part 4: the identity-verifying control client for the D7 pipe.

The pipe SERVER already verifies the CLIENT: it impersonates the caller
(``ImpersonateNamedPipeClient``) and gates each command through ``authz``. This
module is the REVERSE, anti-squat direction the server cannot provide for
itself: before it sends an admin command, the CLIENT verifies the SERVER's pipe
owner is SYSTEM or ``BUILTIN\\Administrators``.

Why it matters: the D7 pipe SDDL keeps ``FILE_CREATE_PIPE_INSTANCE`` off the
Authenticated-Users ACE, so an unprivileged process cannot create a SECOND
instance of an existing pipe -- but if the real supervisor is not yet up, an
unprivileged process CAN create the name FIRST (a squat). A client that blindly
connects to ``\\.\pipe\civiccast-supervisor`` could then hand a squatter a
``stop``/``runtime_set``, or be phished by a fake ``status``. The fix: read the
server pipe object's OWNER SID (``GetSecurityInfo`` OWNER info) and REFUSE to
transact unless it is a trusted system owner. The real supervisor's pipe,
created by the LocalSystem service, is owned by SYSTEM; a squatter's pipe is
owned by the squatting user.

The owner read and the wire transport are injected seams, so the
accept-trusted / refuse-squatted decision runs on Linux in CI with fakes
(``tests/native/test_supervisor_control_client.py``). The REAL named-pipe round
trip + a real server owner SID is VM-bound (a real running server to connect to
is itself the venue dependency; disclosed in ``evidence/PENDING.md``). Windows
imports (``pywintypes``/``win32file``/``win32security``) are LAZY -- this module
imports on Linux.
