"""The Windows service layer for the native supervisor (spec D1/D8).

This module is the OS-facing shim that the Windows Service Control Manager
drives. It owns four things and NOTHING that belongs to the pure ``core.py``
state machine:

* **The pywin32 ``ServiceFramework`` shim (D1/D8).** ``build_service_class``
  lazily constructs the ``CivicCastSupervisorService`` subclass so that
  ``import civiccast.native.supervisor.service`` succeeds on Linux (no
  ``win32serviceutil``/``servicemanager``/``win32service`` at module import --
  they are imported inside the factory, only ever called on Windows). The
  service's ``SvcDoRun`` acquires the singleton, configures logging, and runs a
  :class:`SupervisorService`; ``SvcStop`` requests a graceful stop.
* **The ``Global\\CivicCastSupervisorSingleton`` mutex.** Exactly ONE supervisor
  per station. The mutex REUSES ``win_probes.RuntimeOwnerMutex`` (the WS4 empirical
  Win32 path -- the DACL check happens on a second open, the abandoned-mutex
  classification, the handle-lifetime discipline) rather than hand-rolling a new
  ``CreateMutex`` path; it is parametrised with the singleton identity
  (``config.SINGLETON_MUTEX_NAME``) and the SAME restrictive SDDL as WS4's
  runtime-owner mutex (``config.SINGLETON_MUTEX_SDDL`` == ``MUTEX_SDDL`` ==
  ``D:P(A;;GA;;;SY)(A;;GA;;;BA)`` -- SYSTEM + Administrators only).
* **The graceful stop chain (D5 graceful-stop + RAT-004 drain-all).**
  :meth:`SupervisorService.graceful_stop_all` stops children in reverse startup
  order and issues each child its OWN graceful action first
  (``children.graceful_stop_action`` via the runner): the control-plane child
  (stopped first) gets ``CTRL_BREAK`` so its uvicorn lifespan runs the daemon's
  ``stop_all_channels`` drain (RAT-004), while postgres/nats get their
  command-based stop (pg_ctl fast stop / nats lame-duck ``--signal ldm``). Each
  child then has a 15s deadline (``config.graceful_stop_deadline_seconds``) to
  exit before ``TerminateProcess`` (D5). The Job Object kill-on-close remains the
  final backstop.
* **Logging.** A rotating ``supervisor.log`` (10 MiB x 10) plus per-child log
  paths under ``ProgramData\\CivicCast\\logs``.

Everything side-effecting is injected, so the stop-chain ordering, the
per-child deadline/terminate logic, the runner branching, the logging config,
and the singleton construction all run under pure fakes on Linux
(``tests/native/test_supervisor_service.py``); the real singleton mutex SDDL
readback and the ``ServiceFramework`` class SHAPE are proven against real Win32
in ``tests/native/test_supervisor_service_win.py``.

DISCLOSED SEAMS (owned by a higher integration layer, not this build unit):
* ``build_production_service`` binds the Windows-real seams it CAN (the child
  runner, the Job Object API, the interlock reader, the wall clock) but takes
  the guard monitor, the alerting outbox, and the readiness probes as injected
  parameters -- the guard's lifecycle, the alerting ``AlertConditionKind`` +
  live SQLAlchemy ``Session`` binding (which ``core.py`` explicitly deferred to
  this layer), and the concrete DB/socket/HTTP readiness probes are cross-module
  decisions outside this unit's file ownership.
* ``graceful_stop_all`` calls ``supervisor.graceful_stop()`` at the end for the
  state transition + explicit Job Object close. That method re-issues one
  ``CTRL_BREAK`` to the already-drained (and likely dead) control-plane handle
  before closing the job. This is made SAFE by the runner's ``_safe_ctrl_break``
  (a ``GenerateConsoleCtrlEvent`` against a gone process group would otherwise
  ``OSError`` and crash the stop path), but it is still redundant work -- the
  clean fix is a bare ``close_job`` seam on ``core.Supervisor``, which file
  ownership forbids adding here. Recommended follow-up.

    ADJACENT DEFECT (2026-08-12, TESTER2 b5 evidence): during TESTER2's b5
    run, ``supervisor.log`` was independently observed at 0 bytes across a
    5+ hour service run -- yet the tester's evidence separately quotes ONE
    verbatim, correctly-formatted supervisor line (the ollama-skip WARNING),
    so it demonstrably reached a sink SOMEWHERE. The plain
    ``RotatingFileHandler`` this replaces calls ``flush()`` after every
    ``emit()`` (inherited from ``StreamHandler``), which pushes Python's
    OWN userspace buffer to the OS -- but never asks the OS to publish that
    write to the file's externally-visible size/extent. On Windows, NTFS
    updates a growing file's SIZE metadata in its directory entry lazily
    for a long-lived open handle; a separate process querying size via
    directory enumeration (which is what a simple "how many bytes is this
    file" check does -- e.g. ``Get-Item -Length`` / ``FileInfo.Length`` /
    ``os.path.getsize`` without opening the file) can see 0 (or a stale,
    smaller value) for a handle that stays open for a run's entire
    lifetime, exactly the shape ``supervisor.log`` has (the handler is
    never closed until ``logging.shutdown()`` at service stop). This
    explains BOTH halves of the evidence at once: the WARNING was written
    correctly (retrievable by any tool that actually reads the file's
    content rather than just its cached size, and by anyone who inspected
    it before the handle had been open long), and every SIZE-based
    zero-byte check taken later in the same run is consistent with the
    handle simply having stayed open the whole time.

    ``fsync`` (Windows: ``FlushFileBuffers`` via the C runtime) forces the
    OS to publish the write immediately, closing that gap. Negligible cost

    ``new_process_group`` (the control-plane child, per
    ``spec.new_process_group``) the child is given its OWN process group
    (``CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP``) so a ``CTRL_BREAK`` can later drain only
    its tree (RAT-004) without signalling the supervisor.

    FILE-BACKED, never a pipe: ``child_log_path`` was defined but had no
    caller (G3), so under the SCM every child's stdout/stderr -- including
    nats-server's OWN banner, which run 17's diagnosis needed and did not
    have -- went to inherited-but-unobserved handles and was lost. A pipe
    was deliberately NOT used here: this repo has already lost real runs to
    pipe inheritance (an unread pipe fills its OS buffer and can stall the
    child, or a parent that never drains it never sees the output either).
    The log file handle is opened, handed to ``Popen`` (which duplicates an
    INHERITABLE copy for the child on Windows), and closed again in THIS
    process immediately after spawn -- the child's own inherited copy
    persists independently, so closing here does not touch the child's
    stream.

    WINDOWLESS (F-13, sandbox newcomer re-walk dd7f835f, 2026-08-01): every
    child also gets ``CREATE_NO_WINDOW``. The re-walk found a blank black
    console window titled ``...\\runtime\\python.exe`` left on the operator's
    desktop after install -- and it was not a stray helper, it WAS the live
    control plane (the uvicorn process serving 127.0.0.1:8000); closing it
    killed the station's API. A LocalSystem service has no console of its own
    for a child to inherit, so Windows allocates a NEW, visible one for a
    console-subsystem executable, and ``install_layout.resolve_install_layout``
    resolves ``python_path`` to ``<INSTDIR>\\runtime\\python.exe`` (console
    subsystem), not ``pythonw.exe``.

    Fixed HERE rather than by switching the interpreter to ``pythonw.exe``,
    deliberately: ``pythonw.exe`` has no valid stdout/stderr handles at all,
    which would silently defeat the file-backed capture immediately above --
    the exact regression G3 landed to prevent. ``CREATE_NO_WINDOW`` suppresses
    only the WINDOW; the child keeps the inherited log-file handles.
    ``getattr(..., 0)`` for the same reason as every other spawn site in this
    repo (``pg_ctl_exec``, ``installer/service``, ``provision/seams``,
    ``stream/_ffmpeg``, ``egress/gst/strategy``, ``certs/authority``,
    ``captions/runtime``): the constant does not exist off Windows, where the
    concept does not apply.

    Applies to EVERY child, not just the control plane. postgres.exe,
    nats-server.exe and ollama.exe are console-subsystem executables too; the
    re-walk only caught the control plane because that is the one whose window

ignored who READS the status: the SCM. The service is registered with
``sc failure ... actions= restart/5000/...`` AND ``sc failureflag 1``
(``native_service_registration.rs``), and ``failureflag 1`` makes the SCM apply
those failure actions to ANY nonzero exit, not just a crash. So a fired watchdog
-- which by definition fires while an uninstall or repair is trying to stop this
service -- got the service RESTARTED ~5 seconds later, straight into the
uninstaller's tree removal. The watchdog existed to unblock exactly that
uninstall; a nonzero code made it re-block it.

The diagnosis therefore lives where nothing acts on it automatically: the ERROR
line in ``supervisor.log`` and the Windows Event Log entry, both naming the
stop-chain breadcrumb (:attr:`SupervisorService.stop_position`). Reporting
