"""Configuration model and fixed identity constants for the native supervisor.

Pure data + validation only -- no I/O and no Windows imports, so this module
loads and its parameters are checkable on any OS. Two kinds of thing live here:

1. **WS5-defined identity constants (owner-surfaced).** No upstream spec fixes
   the service's string identity or the singleton mutex name -- spec
   ``spec-supervisor.md`` D1/D3/D7 describe *that* there is a service and a
   ``Global\\`` singleton mutex, but not their exact strings. They are declared
   here once and were surfaced for owner approval (recorded in
   ``civiccast-ws-handoff-artifacts/ws5-owner-decisions-2026-07-20.md``,
   approved 2026-07-20). The singleton's DACL is deliberately identical to
   WS4's runtime-owner mutex per D3/D7's "same explicit SD" clause, so it is
   imported from ``runtime_guard`` rather than re-typed (one source of truth).

2. **The pure D5/D6 parameters** the state logic and (later) the child
   lifecycle are defined in terms of: backoff schedule, restart-storm window,
   graceful-stop deadline, readiness budgets. Cross-field invariants that a
   single ``Field`` constraint cannot express (e.g. ``backoff_max`` must not be
   below ``backoff_initial``) are enforced by an after-validator so a
   nonsensical config fails loudly at construction, matching the house
   ``extra="forbid"`` fail-closed posture.
