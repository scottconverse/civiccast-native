"""The Supervisor -- the orchestration core that drives the states.py machine
from real events (child readiness, guard decisions, the maintenance interlock,
a restart storm, a graceful stop). This is the highest-risk module of the WS5
slice, so it is built to the same discipline as the pure wave-1 modules it
consumes: EVERY side-effecting dependency is an injected seam, so the whole
control flow runs on Linux in CI with fakes and touches no subprocess, no
socket, and no Windows import.

What this module OWNS (design.md Sec.3 ``core.py`` + the ratification addendum):

* **The states.py machine.** ``_dispatch`` is the single place a
  ``SupervisorEvent`` is turned into a new ``SupervisorState`` via the pure
  ``supervisor_transition``; nothing else in the class mutates ``self._state``.
* **Guard integration (WS4 D9 + RAT-002).** ``pre_child_start`` gates every
  (re)start of the writer-capable control-plane child. On the maintenance
  interlock's held->freed edge, ``on_interlock_freed`` performs EXACTLY ONE
  synchronous ``GuardMonitor`` evaluation and emits the composite event that
  matches ``GuardDecision.state_name`` -- ``None`` -> ``interlock_freed_clear``;
  ``"blocked_wsl_active"`` -> ``interlock_freed_blocked_wsl``;
  ``"blocked_probe_unavailable"`` -> ``interlock_freed_blocked_probe`` -- and
  advances no writer-capable child before that evaluation (RAT-002).
* **Maintenance (RAT-001).** ``enter_maintenance`` drives ``interlock_held`` ->
  ``maintenance`` and launches the control-plane child in maintenance mode (env
  ``CIVICCAST_SUPERVISOR_MODE=maintenance`` + ``CIVICCAST_SUPERVISOR_MODE_CONTRACT=1``,
  set by ``children.control_plane_child_spec``). The maintenance-ready gate is
  satisfied ONLY when ``children.check_control_plane_maintenance_ready`` passes;
  otherwise the supervisor STAYS in maintenance (fail-closed).
* **Startup order / readiness (D5/D6).** ``start`` brings up postgres ->
  control plane in ``STARTUP_ORDER``, each gated by ``restart_eligible`` and
  polled ready via ``children.poll_until_ready``. A child that leaves ready is a
  controlled restart eligible only after its dependency re-enters ready. NATS
  JetStream was removed from the product (owner decision 2026-08-20, ADR
  0023) and was never a supervised child of its own -- ``STARTUP_ORDER`` is
  ``(postgres, control_plane)``.
* **Restart storm (D5).** ``evaluate_restart_storm`` demotes to ``degraded`` and
  fires an alert through the injected outbox seam.
* **Drain-all (RAT-004).** ``graceful_stop`` drives ``stop`` -> ``stopping`` and
  sends ``CTRL_BREAK`` to the control-plane process group so its uvicorn
  lifespan runs the daemon's ``stop_all_channels`` drain; the Job Object is the
  backstop only after the deadline.
* **Job Object containment (D3).** Direct children are assigned to the job via
  ``job_object.JobObjectController``; a straggler sweep runs before the first
  spawn.
* **Status snapshot** for the read tier of ``pipe_server`` (``status`` /
  ``version``).

What this module does NOT own (disclosed seams, wired at the service layer):

* The REAL child process I/O (spawn/terminate/CTRL_BREAK) is the injected
  ``ChildProcessRunner``; the real Win32 Job Object and named pipe are covered
  by the wave-1 ``*_win.py`` suites.
* The concrete alerting transport. ``core.py`` fires an abstract alert through
  the injected ``AlertOutbox`` seam; binding it to
  ``civiccast.alerting.store.record_alert_condition`` (and picking the
  ``AlertConditionKind``) is ``service.py``'s job -- that transport needs a live
  SQLAlchemy ``Session`` and cannot run in this pure CI context. See the
  DISCLOSED GAP note in the returned evidence.

        ollama child's launch prerequisites on a throttled cadence, so a model
        store that appears AFTER bring-up starts the runtime without a service
        restart or a reboot.

        Why this cannot be folded into ``_needs_restart``: ``stopped`` must stay
        exempt from the automatic per-tick retry (that exemption is what makes
        ``stopped`` mean "deliberately not running" for every other child, and
        re-stat'ing the install tree every second on a station that will never
        have a local AI runtime is exactly the cost the original design was
        avoiding). So the re-check is a SEPARATE, throttled path with three
        narrow gates:

        * the optional child is configured at all (``_ollama_spec_provider``);
        * it is ``stopped`` **and** carries a ``_start_blocked`` entry -- the
          pairing that uniquely marks "the provider skipped it", as distinct
          from the boot-time ``stopped`` before any attempt and from any future
          deliberate operator stop (which records no ``_start_blocked``, so this
          path will never resurrect it);
        * ``optional_child_recheck_seconds`` has elapsed since the last
          evaluation.

        This does NOT spawn anything and does NOT call the provider itself. All
        it does is move the child out of ``stopped`` into ``starting`` -- the
        same retry-eligible state Audit A3 uses for a guard-withheld start -- so
        that THIS tick's ``_needs_restart``/``_attempt_restart`` pass below asks
        the provider through the one existing spawn path. That keeps a single
        spawn site, with its D5 backoff arming, storm accounting and not-ready
        logging intact, instead of a second one racing it inside the same tick
        (which would burn two readiness budgets back to back and count two
        restarts for one real attempt).

        If the provider still skips, ``start_child`` puts the child straight
        back to ``stopped`` and re-records the (possibly changed) reason for the
        status read tier, and ``_attempt_restart`` leaves the backoff untouched
        because nothing was spawned. The service-layer provider dedupes its
        WARNING per distinct reason, so a permanently AI-less station logs one
        line, not one per minute, and is never demoted to ``degraded`` for
        lacking an optional runtime.

        CC-WS5-016: the admission decision is taken under the lifecycle lock and
        re-checks ``_abort_requested`` there, so this helper observes an operator
        stop the instant it begins. Without it, an authorized control-pipe
        ``stop``/``drain`` could move the machine to ``stopping`` after an
        in-flight tick had passed its outer state gate, and this helper would
        still promote the child to ``starting`` and let the loop below spawn

        CC-WS5-010 (KeyError race, CLOSED): the pipe's ``CommandQueue`` runs this
        on its own worker thread while ``run()``/``tick()`` mutate these same
        fields on the loop thread. The old build did a membership test then an
        index (``name in self._handles`` ... ``self._handles[name]``); a
        concurrent handle removal BETWEEN those two lines raised ``KeyError``,
        which the ``CommandQueue`` surfaced as a transient ``status:error``. The
        fix snapshots every mutable structure into a LOCAL once at the top
        (copy-then-build): each ``dict(...)`` copy is atomic under the GIL, and
        the ``ChildStatusView`` list + ``StatusSnapshot`` are built from the
        LOCAL copies ONLY (never re-reading ``self._...``), so no
        test/index pair can tear -> no ``KeyError``.

        RESIDUAL (F-REV-5, still disclosed, no crash): the several locals are
        captured microseconds apart, so a cross-field skew can still momentarily
        differ (e.g. ``state`` already advanced to ``starting`` while
        ``child_states`` still shows a stale ``ready``). Impact is bounded to a
        momentarily-inconsistent operator status VIEW that self-corrects on the
        next query -- the supervision logic itself is unaffected. A lock is
        deliberately NOT taken: holding it across a ``tick()`` that blocks in
        ``poll_until_ready`` would stall status queries for up to a child's
        readiness budget (~60s) -- a worse trade than the momentary skew."""
