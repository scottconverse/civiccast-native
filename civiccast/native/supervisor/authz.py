"""The pure two-tier authorization decision for the D7 control pipe.

The control pipe authorizes PER COMMAND, not per pipe (spec D7): the server
impersonates the client, extracts the token's group memberships, and this pure
function decides whether the command is allowed. Keeping the decision pure and
separate from the impersonation I/O means AC-N1 -- "an unprivileged INTERACTIVE
token: ``status`` succeeds, ``stop`` is DENIED" -- is a CI-testable property, not
something only observable on a live Windows box.

Two tiers (D7):

* **status tier** -- ``status`` / ``version``: require Authenticated Users.
* **admin tier** -- ``start`` / ``stop`` / ``restart`` / ``drain`` /
  ``runtime_set``: require ``BUILTIN\\Administrators`` OR ``SYSTEM``.

"INTERACTIVE alone gets read-only" is a consequence, not a separate rule:
INTERACTIVE membership never satisfies the admin tier, and the status tier is
satisfied by Authenticated Users (which an interactive logon token also
carries), so an interactive non-admin caller can read and cannot mutate. Fail
closed: an unrecognized command is denied, and a caller carrying none of the
known groups is denied even the status tier.

``is_mutating`` names the commands D7 requires to be audit-logged with the
caller SID -- the logging itself is I/O the pipe server does; the
classification is pure and lives here so the two never drift.
