"""The pure D2 per-verb delivery/replay policy for the worker control seam.

On Windows the worker control channel is a named pipe carrying acknowledged
delivery (spec D2): the strategy sends ``{"v":1,"id":<uuid>,"cmd":"<line>"}`` and
the worker replies ``{"v":1,"id":<same>,"result":"applied"|"error",...}`` after
the engine applies the command. The four ``parse_control_line`` verbs have
different safety shapes, and this module is the pure policy that decides — with
no pipe, no thread, no engine — what the STRATEGY does on each delivery outcome
and what the WORKER does about redelivery:

* ``reload`` / ``swap`` — at-least-once, idempotent. A lost ack or a
  reconnect reissues the channel's CURRENT DESIRED STATE (the current graph for
  reload, the current role for swap), never a replay of command history.
* ``caption`` — at-most-once, never replayed. Cues are time-bound; a stale
  replayed cue is worse than a missed one, so a lost ack or a restart is
  reported to the daemon as dropped, with no redelivery.
* ``stop`` — terminal, exactly-once-EFFECTIVE. An unacknowledged stop pins the
  channel ``stopping`` and SUPPRESSES both restart and desired-state replay;
  the ground truth for resolution is the observed process exit (the handle),
  not the ack. A stopping channel never resurrects.

Worker-side idempotent redelivery is an LRU of applied ids: a redelivered id
that has already been applied is acknowledged again but not re-enacted.

The engine/pipe I/O lives in the worker and strategy modules; this is the pure
decision they call, so the four falsifications D2 owes (lost ack, duplicate
delivery, worker restart between write and apply, reconnect under load) are
CI-testable against a fake transport.
