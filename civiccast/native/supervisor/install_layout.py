"""The SINGLE source of truth for the installed native layout (audit A1).

On a real install the supervisor runs as LocalSystem inside
``<INSTDIR>\\runtime\\pythonservice.exe`` with CWD ``System32`` and a stock
PATH -- the installer writes NO PATH changes. Every child-process path the
supervisor emits must therefore be ABSOLUTE and derived from the layout the
installer actually produces, never a bare executable name or a CWD-relative
directory.

Verified installer ground truth (do not trust comments elsewhere; these are
the producing modules):

* ``civiccast/native/provision/__main__.py`` (``resolve_provision_paths``):
  the postgres cluster is ``<PROGRAMDATA>\\CivicCast\\data\\pgdata``; the
  server-binaries pack extracts under
  ``<INSTDIR>\\packs\\native-server-binaries\\`` with its executables at
  ``payload\\bin\\`` (``initdb_path`` default). NATS JetStream was removed
  from the product (owner decision 2026-08-20, ADR 0023); this layout no
  longer carries a NATS config or server path.
* ``scripts/build_native_server_pack.py``: the pack payload carries
  ``bin/pg_ctl.exe`` (payload manifest + pins).
* The embedded Python lives at ``<INSTDIR>\\runtime\\python.exe``; the service
  host executable is ``<INSTDIR>\\runtime\\pythonservice.exe`` (same dir), so
  ``sys.executable``'s grandparent IS the install root
  (``station_runtime.station_environment_for_python`` already relies on the
  same ``<root>/runtime/<python>.exe`` shape).

Local-AI (task #57 D2) ground truth -- the ollama runtime has TWO verified
staging conventions in the installer sources, both rooted at the install
root, and the binary exactly one:

* ``apps/installer/src-tauri/src/native_activation.rs``
  (``validate_staged_runtime_layout``): the promoted five-pack station
  carries the reviewed ollama binary at ``dependencies\\ollama\\ollama.exe``
  and the COMPOSED model store (``compose_ollama_model_store``: gemma4:12b +
  gemma4:e4b + translategemma:4b manifests/blobs hard-linked out of the
  signed model components) at ``models\\ollama\\``. The installer's own
  production D2 self-test (``main.rs``'s ``NativeOllamaSelfTestServer``)
  starts exactly that binary with ``OLLAMA_MODELS`` pointed at exactly that
  store.
* ``apps/installer/src-tauri/src/acquisition_catalog.rs``
  (``local_ai_model_root``): the acquisition download experience (task #56)
  stages gemma4:12b's manifest+blobs, in Ollama's own on-disk grammar, at
  ``packs\\local-ai-model\\models\\`` -- the same ``packs\\`` folder the
  other acquisition components use. That flow wires NO ollama binary
  component (``PRODUCTION_CATALOG_IDS`` carries none), so on an
  acquisition-only install the binary path below may simply not exist --
  callers must gate on existence and degrade, never assume.

ffmpeg/ffprobe ground truth: ``apps/installer/src-tauri/src/native_activation.rs``
(``validate_staged_runtime_layout``'s ``required_files`` list) pins
``dependencies/ffmpeg/bin/ffmpeg.exe`` as a required file of the promoted
staged runtime -- the same ``dependencies\\<tool>\\`` convention
``ollama_exe_path`` above already uses. ``ffprobe.exe`` ships beside
``ffmpeg.exe`` in the same ``bin`` directory (standard ffmpeg distribution
layout; not independently listed in ``required_files`` but staged by the
same packaging step). Pure path arithmetic like every other field here:
existence is the CALLER's gate.

``resolve_install_layout`` derives everything from ``sys.executable`` and
``%PROGRAMDATA%`` (the env var is honored -- ``service.py`` previously
hardcoded ``C:\\ProgramData`` for the log root; that divergence is closed by
routing the log root through here). Pure path arithmetic: nothing is created
and nothing must exist at resolution time, so the resolver also runs under a
test-fabricated tree. On a NON-installed interpreter (a dev venv) the derived
paths are structurally correct but point at a tree that does not exist; the
production service host is always the installed ``runtime`` shape.

    ARITHMETIC: they reconstruct where the package *should* be from a root
    they are handed. That arithmetic is correct for the layout the installer
    produces today (``native_pack_staging::pack_extraction_destination``
    bridges ``native-app-payload`` to ``<INSTDIR>\\runtime``, and

    description of a layout the interpreter already knows first-hand, and a

    This one cannot drift: the portals are members of the ``civiccast``
    package, so ``civiccast.__file__``'s parent IS the package root the

    FALLBACK: an interpreter with no package file at all (frozen/zipimport)
    has no ``__file__`` to derive from. There the proven root arithmetic
    above stands in, resolved from ``sys.executable``. On the real layout the
