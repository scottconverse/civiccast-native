"""Job Object containment for the native supervisor (spec D3).

The supervisor's containment guarantee (AC4: "kill the SUPERVISOR mid-playout
-> Job Object kills the tree, no orphan postgres.exe/nats-server.exe/python
workers survive") rests on THREE Win32 primitives, wrapped here so no other
module in this package touches ``win32job``/``win32api`` directly:

1. ``CreateJobObject`` + ``JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE`` -- the job's
   last handle closing (including the implicit close on process exit/crash,
   which the kernel always performs) kills every process still assigned to
   it. Breakaway is left DISABLED (D3): ``JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_BREAKAWAY_OK`` /
   ``_SILENT_BREAKAWAY_OK`` are never set, so a descendant cannot detach
   itself from the containment tree. Workers spawned by the control-plane
   daemon (D2) are captured automatically as descendants of the ``postgres``/
   ``nats``/``control_plane`` direct children this module assigns -- the
   supervisor never assigns a worker pid itself.
2. ``AssignProcessToJobObject`` -- ``JobObjectController.assign_child(pid)``,
   the seam ``core.py``'s child-lifecycle code calls once per direct child
   after it launches.
3. ``OpenJobObject`` + ``TerminateJobObject`` by the well-known job name --
   the D3 "straggler sweep... run before spawning (defense in depth)". The
   common case is kill-on-close having already reaped everything, so
   ``OpenJobObject`` fails with ``ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND`` and there is nothing
   to sweep; a same-named job surviving past its creator (some handle
   somewhere kept it alive -- e.g. a crash sequence that raced the kernel's
   own handle-table teardown, or a future code path that duplicates the
   handle) is the defense-in-depth case: reopen it by NAME, list its current
   member pids, ``TerminateJobObject`` them, and close. This is the
   Windows-native form of "sweep by job-name"; it needs no process-marker
   scanning (no ``psutil`` environ/cmdline scan, which can itself fail across
   privilege/session boundaries) because the job object itself is the
   authoritative, kernel-maintained member list -- a strictly stronger
   source of truth than a marker guess.

Pure-testable seam (D3 build note: "assign/sweep control logic with a fake
job API"). ``JobObjectApi`` is the injectable Protocol; ``JobObjectController``
(assign) and :func:`sweep_stragglers` (sweep) are pure control logic over it,
exercised in ``tests/native/test_supervisor_job_object.py`` with a fake that
never touches Win32, on any OS. ``Win32JobObjectApi`` is the one real
implementation, and it is the ONLY thing in this module that imports
``win32job``/``win32api``/``pywintypes`` -- always lazily, inside each method,
per the house rule that ``import civiccast.native.*`` must succeed on Linux.
``tests/native/test_supervisor_job_object_win.py`` (``win`` in the filename
per the D3/CI naming convention, ``pytest.mark.skipif(os.name != "nt")``)
exercises it against real Win32 objects and a real spawned child tree.

Empirical corrections applied from ``win_probes.py``'s module docstring
(disclosed there as house-wide, not WS4-specific):

- **Handle lifetime.** The process handle ``win32api.OpenProcess`` opens
  purely to make ``AssignProcessToJobObject``/``IsProcessInJob`` calls is
  closed immediately after each call (``finally``), never parked on
  ``self`` -- the job keeps its own reference to the assigned process; an
  extra open handle per call would leak one kernel handle per assign, exactly
  the class of bug ``RuntimeOwnerMutex`` was fixed for (round-2 audit,
  ``win_probes.py:625-628``).
- **Explicit SD, never the default DACL (F-JOB-1).** The job is a GLOBAL
  named object; the program discipline (spec D7 for the pipe; the singleton
  and runtime-owner mutexes) is an EXPLICIT security descriptor, never the
  token-default DACL. ``create_job`` builds a ``SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES`` from
  ``JOB_OBJECT_SDDL`` (identical to the mutex SDDL: SYSTEM +
  BUILTIN\\Administrators GENERIC_ALL, nobody else) so an unprivileged token
  can neither open nor ``TerminateJobObject`` the station's process tree.
  ``read_dacl_sddl`` reads it back for the ``*_win.py`` SD proof; note
  ``ConvertSecurityDescriptorToStringSecurityDescriptor`` normalizes "GA" to
  the object-specific mask on readback, so that test asserts on the SID
  markers (``;;;SY)``, ``;;;BA)``, absence of ``;;;WD``), not the literal "GA".
- **Empirically verified, not merely assumed** (spike transcript in this
  unit's evidence): ``QueryInformationJobObject(..., JobObjectBasicProcessIdList)``
  returns a plain tuple of ints (``(pid, ...)``), not a dict keyed by a
  ``"ProcessIdList"`` field as the MSDN struct name might suggest --
  confirmed on this dev box before being relied on in
  :meth:`Win32JobObjectApi.list_job_process_ids`.
