"""CC-WS5-007 (round 4): the MODULE-LEVEL, import-resolvable SCM service host.

**Windows-only.** This module imports pywin32 at the TOP, so it MUST NOT be
imported at module-load time by ``service.py`` (which stays Linux-importable) --
``service.py`` imports it LAZILY inside ``main()`` on Windows, and the SCM host
process (``pythonservice.exe``) imports it to resolve the persisted service
class string. No Linux-run test imports this module.

Beta BLOCKER #48 (2026-07-30): this docstring previously claimed ``SvcDoRun``
"resolves the persisted service config" -- it did not; nothing bridged the
installer-persisted ``DatabaseUrl`` registry value into the service process's
environment, so ``default_dependency_provider`` always found ``DATABASE_URL``
empty and crashed the service on every real install (Sandbox gauntlet run 11:
pywin32 exit 0x20000001, SCM auto-restarts twice, then STOPPED/1066). Fixed:
``SvcDoRun`` now calls
:func:`civiccast.native.supervisor.service_env.ensure_database_url_env` FIRST,
before the singleton mutex or ``_service_factory`` run -- it reads
``HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\CivicCast\\Native\\DatabaseUrl`` via ``winreg`` ONLY when
``DATABASE_URL`` is not already set in the environment (an explicit env var
always wins, e.g. an operator/test override), and raises a precise, fail-loud
error naming both the registry path and the env var (never the URL value,
which carries the DB password) when neither source has one. See
``service_env.py`` for the cross-platform-importable bridge implementation and
its constants (pinned to the Rust writer in ``native_service_registration.rs``).

Why this module exists (the CC-WS5-007 critical fix)
----------------------------------------------------
The earlier ``service.build_service_class`` created ``CivicCastSupervisorService``
as a **function-local** class (qualname
``build_service_class.<locals>.CivicCastSupervisorService``). pywin32 persists a
service class string of ``module + cls.__name__`` -- i.e.
``civiccast.native.supervisor.service.CivicCastSupervisorService`` -- but there
is NO module-global class of that name, so when the separate SCM host process
imports the module and resolves the persisted string it finds NOTHING and the
service cannot start. Separately, the ``service_factory`` was a CLOSURE built in
the INSTALLER process; the SCM host is a SEPARATE process that cannot receive
that closure (``default_dependency_provider`` would then raise). Both are fixed
here:

* the service class is **module-level** (``CivicCastSupervisorService`` below),
  so its persisted class string
  (``civiccast.native.supervisor.service_host.CivicCastSupervisorService``)
  resolves from a fresh import in the host process; and
* its ``SvcDoRun`` builds the production dependencies **IN this host process**
  via the module-level :data:`_service_factory` (the production assembly, NOT an
  installer closure).

Everything the class needs to build the service (the singleton mutex, the
logging configurator, the production service factory) is referenced as a
module-level name, so a Windows-only test can substitute fakes (via
``monkeypatch``) and drive ``SvcDoRun`` through ``__new__`` -- proving the
in-process assembly and the fail-loudly-on-a-raising-provider path -- without
registering or running under the real SCM.
