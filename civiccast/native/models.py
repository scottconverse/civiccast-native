"""Typed shapes for the dual-runtime exclusion guard (slice:ws4-dual-runtime-guard).

These types are the seam between the pure decision table in
``civiccast.native.runtime_guard`` and the real Windows probes in
``civiccast.native.win_probes``: every probe result and every guard decision
is a pydantic model with ``extra="forbid"`` (house pattern) so a malformed or
schema-drifted value fails loudly at parse time rather than being silently
tolerated. Derived pass/fail is always a ``@property``, never a manually set
boolean (``CutoverJournal.ok``).

Honest boundary: these are shapes only. They encode no I/O and no policy --
see ``runtime_guard.decide`` for the D3 decision table and ``win_probes`` for
what each probe actually reads.
