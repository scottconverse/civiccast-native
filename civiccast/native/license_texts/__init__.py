"""Canonical, version-controlled license text bundled with the native
Windows runtime closure (`spec-packaging-closure` D3, Codex audit finding
CC-WS5-PKG-004).

D3 requires the required upstream notices to be BUNDLED with the runtime --
LGPL-2.1-or-later and MPL-2.0 in particular REQUIRE the license text itself
to accompany the binaries, and a bill-of-materials table naming a license is
not a substitute for that text. Before this module existed,
`scripts/build_native_runtime_closure.py` wrote only a per-distribution
SUMMARY (`<out>/licenses/<distribution>.txt`, the wheel's own declared SPDX
expression) -- never the license text itself.

This directory holds the fix: one `<spdx-id>.txt` file per SPDX identifier
that `civiccast.native.runtime_licenses` actually resolves a shipped file
to, fetched from spdx.org's own published license-list-data and committed
to the repo AS DATA, so a build never needs the network to be legally
complete (a build that needs the network to bundle a legally required
notice is a build that fails at the worst moment -- see the module doc on
`scripts/build_native_runtime_closure.py`). Each text file is stored
byte-for-byte as published, with no CivicCast commentary inside it; the
provenance for each is recorded in `LICENSE_TEXT_SOURCES` below instead of
as an in-band header, so the bundled text stays a clean, verbatim copy.

The one exception is `LicenseRef-Microsoft-VCRedist.txt`, which is NOT a
reproduction of any license text -- see its own contents and the entry in
`LICENSE_TEXT_SOURCES` for why: the Microsoft VC++ Redistributable EULA is
proprietary and CivicCast has no license to reproduce it, so that file is a
pointer to where an operator can find the real terms, plainly labelled as
such.

`scripts/build_native_runtime_closure.py` decides WHICH of these texts get
copied into a given build by walking the built tree's own manifest/BOM
(`available_license_texts()` below is a directory listing, not a hardcoded
"ship these N licenses" list) -- so a future license appearing in the
shipped BOM with no corresponding file here is a build-time gap this module
can be asked about, not a silent omission.
