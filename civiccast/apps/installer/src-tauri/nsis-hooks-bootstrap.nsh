; Small native bootstrap hooks. The multi-gigabyte station payload is supplied
; only through signed .ccpack files and is never embedded in this NSIS binary.
;
; This is the ONE LIVE native installer hook file: `tauri.native.conf.json`
; (`bundle.windows.nsis.installerHooks`) references this file, and
; `tests/policy/test_native_installer_identity.py` pins that reference on the
; EFFECTIVE (deep-merged) native config. `scripts/build_native_bootstrap.py`'s
; `validate_native_bootstrap_config` is a hard gate requiring exactly this
; file name plus a `bundle.resources` map of exactly three tiny entries:
;   resources/vc_redist.x64.exe       -> vc_redist.x64.exe
;   resources/station/station-index.json -> station/station-index.json
;   resources/station/core.ccpack        -> station/core.ccpack
; -- no embedded multi-gigabyte payload, ever. The two station entries were
; added 2026-09-02 (owner decision) so a DOWNLOAD-ONLY install/upgrade of
; setup.exe alone still has the signed station index it must activate
; against; the signed index is a few KB and `core.ccpack` is ~1.5 KB (its
; payload is a placeholder NOTICE, never runtime bytes -- see
; scripts/build_native_station_bundle.py::_core_placeholder_sources). The
; model packs the index names stay out of this binary and are obtained from
; the kit's own station directory or the per-SHA pack cache. See the
; d4-activate-station step's own comment for the two-source resolution
; order.
;
; WP2 hook-migration (2026-07-30): POSTINSTALL below now carries the D2/D4
; install-time chain that previously sat unreachable in the retired
; `nsis-hooks-native.nsh` (that file's own header, and two independent same-
; day evidence trails -- `wp2-pack-delivery-reconciliation-2026-07-29.md` and
; `wp2-hook-build-wiring-2026-07-30.md` -- had disclosed it was fully built
; and unit-tested but wired into NO live build target). The coordinator
; decided this file, not `nsis-hooks-native.nsh`, is where that chain belongs
; (folding it in here rather than re-pointing the Tauri config, which two
; policy/builder tests pin against). Full migration map, adaptation
; rationale, and what was deliberately NOT migrated (and why):
; .agent-runs/native-windows/ws5-installer/evidence/wp2-hook-migration-2026-07-30.md
;
; Ordering summary (bootstrap-native: packs deliver runtime bytes, so
; verification, the D3 engine, and provisioning all run AFTER pack staging,
; not before, unlike the retired file's embedded-payload ordering):
;   stage required component packs -> D2 re-verify the extracted pack tree
;   -> D3 journaled install/upgrade engine -> D4 PostgreSQL provisioning
;   -> D4 service registration + firewall rule. Every step fails loud on
;   failure via CIVICCAST_FAIL: a silent-safe operator report, a
;   step-identifying process exit code, and a real NSIS Abort so the wizard
;   reports failure instead of running Tauri's unconditional success page
;   (AUDIT-001).
;
; WP2 app-payload-pack gap closure (2026-07-30): the gap named below is now
; CLOSED. `scripts/build_native_app_payload_pack.py` packages the WP-6
; application-payload TREE (CPython 3.12 embeddable + civiccast + hash-pinned
; deps) as a signed `native-app-payload` component pack;
; `native_pack_staging::DEFAULT_REQUIRED_COMPONENTS` now demands it
; (`["native-server-binaries", "native-app-payload"]`), and
; `native_pack_staging::ensure_pack_extracted` special-cases its extraction
; destination to `$INSTDIR\runtime` (NOT the generic
; `packs\native-app-payload\payload\` convention every other component pack
; uses) so `$INSTDIR\runtime\python.exe` -- the interpreter both the D4
; provisioning and D4 service-registration CLI subcommands below shell out to
; internally (`native_service_registration.rs`) -- now exists after pack
; staging completes. See `wp2-app-payload-pack-2026-07-30.md` for the full
; layout-bridge rationale and build/verification evidence.
;
; WP2 D3 rehoming (2026-07-30): the app-payload-pack gap closure above is what
; made the D3 install/upgrade engine (`civiccast.native.upgrade`) invocable at
; all -- `wp2-hook-migration-2026-07-30.md` §2 explicitly left it unwired
; because `$INSTDIR\runtime\python.exe` did not exist yet. It is now wired,
; as a THIN SHELL exactly like the retired block's own invocation (direct
; `nsExec::ExecToLog` of the embedded interpreter, no Rust CLI subcommand
; wrapper, unlike the D4 steps beside it): reads the currently-installed ARP
; version, branches on the retired block's own 5-way exit-code contract
; (commit / clean rollback / halted rollback needing operator recovery /
; refused non-restorable migration / unexpected fault), and passes
; `--payload-source "$INSTDIR\runtime"`. POSITION (coordinator decision): runs
; directly after the D2 pack-tree verification above and BEFORE D4
; provisioning/service registration below -- tree management (junction flip,
; migration, health gate, rollback) must commit on the tree before
; provisioning/service-build acts on it. See
; `wp2-d3-rehoming-2026-07-30.md` for the retired-block diff comparison, the
; exit-contract table, and the one real adaptation this position forces (the
; `--database-url` value D3 receives is now the registry's CURRENT value,
; read BEFORE D4 provisioning below can write a fresh one -- empty on a
; first-ever install, unlike the retired ordering where D4 always ran first).

; Durable install-progress breadcrumbs. DetailPrint output is invisible in
; silent installs and lost when the process dies, which made the run-3/run-4
; Sandbox hang (setup alive, no children, no observable position in the
; chain) undiagnosable from outside. Every chain step below writes a line to
; $COMMONPROGRAMDATA\CivicCast\install-progress.log BEFORE and AFTER it
; runs, so the last line always names the step in flight. This file is also
; what the fault dialogs' "see the installer log" now concretely means for
; operators. Uses $9 (saved/restored) to avoid disturbing chain registers.
; Timestamped (P3 instrumentation, 2026-07-31 run-18 forensic diagnosis): a
; breadcrumb line alone proves ORDER, not TIMING -- diagnosing a hang (this
; file's own header names the run-3/run-4 Sandbox hang this log format was
; built to make diagnosable) needs to know how long the install sat on its
; LAST logged step, which the untimestamped format could not answer without
; correlating against a process-exit timestamp from outside the file.
; ${__DATE__}/${__TIME__} are COMPILE-time constants baked into this
; installer once at build time -- every line would carry the SAME wrong
; value -- so they are explicitly not usable here. ${GetTime} (FileFunc.nsh;
; already !include'd by installer.nsi at the top of the generated script,
; strictly before this file's own !include site, and again strictly before
; any !insertmacro CIVICCAST_STEP call site, so it is always in scope) is
; the least invasive runtime option available: it is NSIS's own official
; time helper, built on the standard LOGICLIB "artificial function" calling
; convention already used elsewhere in this toolchain, and it does not
; disturb $0/$1 externally by design (that convention's own internal
; Exch-based save/restore is the entire point of it) -- unlike a raw
; `System::Call kernel32::GetLocalTime` probe, which would need hand-built
; SYSTEMTIME pointer/struct arithmetic for no accuracy benefit at this log's
; one-second granularity.
;
; Every existing CIVICCAST_STEP call site inherits this prefix automatically
; (this is the ONE place the format is produced). The prefix is a PREFIX,
; not a replacement -- every previously-logged token (`step d4-provision:
; returned 0`, `REFUSED`, `step d3-engine: begin (old=...)`, etc.) still
; appears verbatim later in the same line. Every known consumer matches with
; an unanchored substring/regex search (grep confirms:
; C:\CivicCastProof\sandbox-shared\gauntlet-run18\install_gauntlet.ps1 uses
; PowerShell `-match` with no `^`/`$` anchor at every one of its six
; breadcrumb-matching call sites -- 'REFUSED', 'step d4-provision: returned
; 0', and the regex-escaped 'step d3-engine: begin \(old=...\)' among them --
; and a repo-wide search found no OTHER consumer of install-progress.log at
; all), so a leading `[timestamp] ` prefix cannot break any of them. See
; tests/policy/test_native_installer_identity.py for the pin covering the
; prefix shape and the BEGIN line above.
;
; Registers: $2-$8 hold ${GetTime}'s seven required outputs (day, month,
; year, day-of-week [captured but unused -- this log format has never
; carried a weekday and adding one is not this fix's job], hour, minute,
; second). Chosen because those seven are used NOWHERE ELSE in this file
; (confirmed by grep) -- unlike $0, $1, $9, and $R0-$R3, which ARE live
; inside various CIVICCAST_STEP callers' own ${TEXT} argument (e.g.
; "...returned $0", "...(old=$R0)", "...$CIVICCAST_TEARDOWN_EXIT") and must
; still hold their CALLER's value, unmodified, by the time this macro's own
; FileWrite resolves that same ${TEXT} text. Still Push/Pop-saved so the
; CALLER's $2-$8 are restored after the macro -- but the Push/Pop does NOT
; make $2-$9 usable INSIDE a ${TEXT} argument: ${TEXT} expands textually at
; the FileWrite, which runs AFTER ${GetTime} has clobbered $2-$8 and after
; the file handle landed in $2 (measured 2026-07-31: a probe site logging
; "$2...$9" printed the timestamp fields and the handle, not the caller's
; values). Never reference $2-$9 in breadcrumb text.
;
; SIDE EFFECT (measured 2026-07-31): ${GetTime} routes through FileFunc's
; GetTime_, which calls ClearErrors unconditionally -- so EVERY
; CIVICCAST_STEP call clears the NSIS error flag. All current call sites
; were traced and none read the flag across a STEP, but do not place a
; STEP between a SetErrors/${GetOptions} and its ${If} ${Errors} check.

; HONEST INSTALL-SIZE METADATA (F-10/F-12, 2026-08-01, FINDINGS-rewalk-
; dd7f835f.md): the wizard's "Choose Install Location" page showed "Space
; required: 237.0 MB", and Windows' Installed apps showed 37.1 MB, against a
; real ~1.19 GB on-disk install (plus up to ~12.8 GB of first-run
; downloads). Both numbers came from NSIS/Tauri machinery that can only see
; what THIS installer embeds via `File` statements (the bootstrap exe, the
; VC++ redistributable, the WebView2 offline installer) -- it has no way to
; know about the native component packs the POSTINSTALL chain below stages
; via external `nsExec` calls, which is most of the real footprint. Two
; separate, complementary fixes, because the two numbers are needed at two
; different times:
;
; 1. The pre-install "Space required" estimate (MUI_PAGE_DIRECTORY, shown
;    BEFORE anything is staged, so it cannot be measured -- it can only be
;    declared). NSIS's documented mechanism for exactly this case is
;    `AddSize` ("increases... the size used to calculate the estimated
;    space required... for actions the installer performs that increase
;    install size beyond what NSIS can auto-detect", e.g. downloads/
;    extractions done by an external process): see
;    CIVICCAST_ADDSIZE_PACKS_KB below and its use in NSIS_HOOK_PREINSTALL.
;    DERIVATION: 5,400,000 KB is the conservative current budget for all four
;    raw sidecars plus their extracted trees. The candidate workflow sums the
;    actual `pack_bytes` + `payload_bytes` from every signed builder report and
;    fails before packaging if that exact build exceeds this declaration, so
;    source or manifest growth cannot silently make the wizard understate the
;    required space. The post-install EstimatedSize remains measured from the
;    real tree below.
; 2. The ARP "Installed apps" size (EstimatedSize, read by Windows AFTER
;    install completes) does not have this before/after problem -- by the
;    time NSIS_HOOK_POSTINSTALL reaches its final steps, every pack has
;    actually been staged and D2-verified, so the true footprint can be
;    MEASURED instead of estimated. See the ${GetSize} "$INSTDIR" call near
;    the end of NSIS_HOOK_POSTINSTALL, which overwrites Tauri's own (tiny,
;    File-statement-only) EstimatedSize write with the real number --
;    self-correcting on every future build, unlike a hardcoded constant.

; Fail the install for real (AUDIT-001, Blocker, 2026-07-30).
;
; Before this macro, every POSTINSTALL failure branch below did SetErrors +
; alert + `Goto ...done` and nothing else. NSIS's `.onInstFailed` is documented
; to fire only on a failed extraction or an explicit `Abort` -- `SetErrors` is
; NOT a trigger -- and Tauri's generated installer.nsi defines no
; `.onInstFailed` at all while running `.onInstSuccess` unconditionally. So a
; machine whose provisioning, service registration, or pack verification had
; just failed still showed the wizard's "installation complete" page, still
; carried a healthy Add/Remove Programs entry, and still returned exit code 0
; to any deployment tool driving it silently.
;
; The shape below is not inferred from documentation; it was measured on this
; product's own makensis. Evidence:
; .agent-runs/native-windows/ws5-installer/evidence/nsis-errorlevel-probe/
;   SetErrorLevel alone   -> custom exit code, but .onInstSuccess STILL runs
;   Abort alone           -> .onInstFailed runs, but the generic exit code 2
;   SetErrorLevel + Abort -> custom exit code AND .onInstFailed  <- what we want
;
; CODE is this product's own step-identifying exit code (the table below), so
; an unattended caller can tell WHICH step failed from the process exit code
; alone -- the only signal a silent install emits.
;
; What this deliberately does NOT do: retract Tauri's Add/Remove Programs
; entry or delete the uninstaller it wrote at installer.nsi:649/670-689,
; before this hook ever runs. Both were considered and rejected on evidence:
;   * UninstallString is the ONLY way Windows' own Apps & Features UI can
;     invoke our uninstaller, and the uninstaller is now the thing that
;     actually cleans a half-installed machine (service, firewall rule,
;     recursive tree removal). Deleting the ARP entry would strand a
;     multi-gigabyte tree with no discoverable way to remove it.
;   * scripts/wait_native_uninstall_cleanup.ps1 decides an uninstall finished
;     by matching ARP DisplayName == "CivicCast (Native)" and finding none.
;     Deleting or renaming the entry on a FAILED install would make that
;     watcher report a clean machine that is not clean.
; So a failed install stays visible and removable; what changes is that it no
; longer claims to have succeeded.
; <installer-path-audit BL-02> Set to "1" by NSIS_HOOK_POSTINSTALL's first
; step. From that instant on, $INSTDIR holds the NEW payload (Tauri's own
; generated section replaced the files before this hook runs, and pack
; staging writes the new runtime into $INSTDIR\runtime a few steps later),
; while the database is still the OLD, unmigrated one until D3 commits.
; CIVICCAST_FAIL consults this to decide whether a failure needs service
; containment. Deliberately NOT set during PREINSTALL: a PREINSTALL failure
; aborts before any file is replaced, so the existing install is intact and
; its auto-start service is exactly what the operator should keep.

; extracted the NEW payload into BEFORE the engine ever ran -- there is no

; that mismatched pair. This code is distinct from CIVICCAST_EXIT_D3_HALTED

  ; download remedy (chain F-min, 2026-08-01: a real tester hit this abort --
  ; child exit 74, hook exit 110 -- and was told to connect the machine to the
  ; network, which could not have helped).
  ;
  ; `--civiccast-stage-packs` verifies every candidate pack's signature + byte
  ; inventory BEFORE copying, re-verifies the landed copy, then extracts each
  ; required payload to its product-owned destination: server binaries under
  ; `$INSTDIR\packs`, the application under `$INSTDIR\runtime`, and FFmpeg /
  ; Ollama under `$INSTDIR\dependencies`. An already-verified extracted tree
  ; is left untouched. An unsatisfied required component is a loud abort
  ; naming the side-load remedy. No `--require-component` flag is passed, so
  ; the effective required set is exactly
  ; `native_pack_staging::DEFAULT_REQUIRED_COMPONENTS`: server binaries,
  ; application payload, FFmpeg runtime, and Ollama runtime.
  ;

  ; else -- the pane is not install-progress.log, and under `/S` there is no
  ; pane at all -- so the promise could not be kept. ExecToStack captures it
  ; into $1 instead, and the failure arm below hands it to CIVICCAST_STEP,
  ; the one macro in this file that writes that log.
  ;
  ; ExecToStack costs nothing that ExecToLog was providing: native_pack_staging.rs
  ; contains ZERO print/println/eprintln calls (grepped), so the child emits
  ; nothing at all until it exits -- there is no progressive output for the
  ; pane to lose while the multi-gigabyte extraction runs. ExecToStack is
  ; already this file's established capture idiom (the uninstall-preflight
  ; calls in NSIS_HOOK_PREUNINSTALL use it the same way, exit code then
  ; output). $1 truncates at ${NSIS_MAX_STRLEN}; on the failure path the

  ; D3 JOURNALED INSTALL/UPGRADE ENGINE (spec-installer-lifecycle.md D3;
  ; rehomed from the retired nsis-hooks-native.nsh's NSIS_HOOK_POSTINSTALL --
  ; left unwired by the prior hook-migration because $INSTDIR\runtime\
  ; python.exe did not exist in any bootstrap build target yet; the
  ; app-payload-pack gap closure above (bce9a3cf) bridges the native-
  ; app-payload pack's extraction to exactly that path, and the D2
  ; re-verification two blocks above re-checks that bridged tree before this
  ; call trusts it. See the file header and wp2-d3-rehoming-2026-07-30.md.
  ; ===================================================================
  ; Runs as a THIN SHELL -- all D3 logic (acquire interlock -> drain+verify
  ; quiescence -> verified pre-upgrade backup -> lay tree + flip junction ->
  ; migrate -> maintenance/read-only health gate -> commit, with the defined
  ; rollback and rollback-failure recovery paths) lives in tested Python
  ; (civiccast.native.upgrade), never in NSIS script; the engine is
  ; idempotently resumable from its own journal.
  ;
  ; POSITION (coordinator decision): runs HERE -- after D2 pack-tree
  ; verification and BEFORE D4 provisioning/service registration below --
  ; because tree management (junction flip, migration, health gate, rollback)
  ; must commit on the tree BEFORE provisioning/service-build acts on it.
  ;
  ; Contract of the call (exit code -> installer branch):
  ;   0  committed        10 clean rollback (old version healthy)
  ;   11 fresh install    — no installed product; the engine is not applicable
  ;   12 same version     — nothing to migrate; the engine did not run
  ;   20 HALTED — operator recovery doc emitted (see ProgramData\CivicCast\upgrade)
  ;   30 refused (declared non-restorable migration; needs operator ack)
  ;   40 unexpected fault
  ; 0/10/20/30/40 are preserved EXACTLY from the retired file. 11 and 12 are
  ; the ROUTING outcomes added by chain K/K2 (see below); neither is a failure
  ; and both continue the install. The numeric ladder is cross-checked against
  ; civiccast/native/upgrade/__main__.py's _EXIT_CODES and _ROUTE_EXIT_CODES
  ; in BOTH directions by tests/policy/test_native_installer_identity.py, so a
  ; code the engine can emit without a branch here fails the build.
  ;
  ; $R0 = the version installed by the PREVIOUS successful run of this chain,
  ; from the product-owned InstalledVersion marker ("none" on a fresh
  ; install). NOT the ARP DisplayVersion: Tauri's generated install section
  ; writes ARP (including DisplayVersion) BEFORE NSIS_HOOK_POSTINSTALL runs,
  ; so by the time this gate executes ARP always shows the version being
  ; installed RIGHT NOW — it can neither detect a fresh install nor supply
  ; the true old version during an upgrade. Proven live in Sandbox matrix
  ; row 1, 2026-07-30: the ARP-keyed gate never fired, the engine ran with
  ; an empty --database-url and faulted (exit 1). The marker is written only
  ; at the fully-successful end of this chain (below) and, like DatabaseUrl,
  ; deliberately survives uninstall (the database cluster is preserved), so
  ; reinstall-over-existing-data correctly runs the engine as an upgrade.
  ; $R2 = the DatabaseUrl registry value AS IT STANDS RIGHT NOW. ADAPTATION
  ; from the retired block: that block read this same key AFTER D4
  ; provisioning had already run (D3 ran after D4 there), so it always saw a
  ; freshly-provisioned value. Here D3 runs BEFORE provisioning, so $R2 is
  ; empty on a first-ever install; provisioning below re-reads the same
  ; (unchanged by D3) key into $R3 for its own decision matrix, so its
  ; fresh-vs-reuse logic is unaffected. See wp2-d3-rehoming-2026-07-30.md.

  ; NATIVE_D4_STATE_INVENTORY). They are DATA-REMNANT signals, not
  ; product-existence signals, so the gate could never fire on a machine that
  ; had ever held a successful install. R7 was exactly that machine: 0 ARP
  ; entries, no CivicCastSupervisor service, no install directory -- and the
  ; installer ran the UPGRADE engine anyway, "upgrading" 1.0.0-rc15 to
  ; 1.0.0-rc15, failing, and ending setup in a rollback dialog that told the
  ; operator that a version which was never installed remained in good health
  ; and running. (The exact wording is not repeated here: chain M3's test
  ; greps this file for that sentence, and a comment quoting it would trip a
  ; pin whose whole job is proving the claim is gone from the product.)
  ;
  ; The decision now lives in tested Python (civiccast/native/upgrade/
  ; routing.py), which is where this file's own contract says all D3 logic
  ; belongs -- the routing gate was the one piece that violated it, and it is
  ; the piece that broke. The engine decides BEFORE it builds any seam or

  ; upgrade classification above already uses, and the only tracked D4 item that

  ; through exit codes 11/12 below.
  ;
  ; The engine is therefore invoked UNCONDITIONALLY now. That is deliberate:
  ; one decision point instead of two that can disagree, and every run --
  ; including a first-ever install -- leaves the routing decision and its
  ; reason in the durable engine log under $COMMONPROGRAMDATA\CivicCast\upgrade,
  ; which is the artifact a support case actually has. $R2 may legitimately be
  ; empty here (D3 runs before D4 provisioning); the routing decision is made

    ; HISTORY: a 2026-07-30 adversarial-review fix stopped this branch from
    ; recording a clean rollback as a SUCCESSFUL upgrade (it used to
    ; DetailPrint only and fall through to the InstalledVersion write at the
    ; end of this macro). It then continued the install with a non-fatal
    ; CIVICCAST_NOTICE, correct ONLY for the app\<version> + junction layout,
    ; where flip_junction really does restore the old binary tree.
    ;
    ; Gate A run 33681670855 CRITICAL fix (2026-09-02) supersedes that
    ; continue-with-notice behavior. This invocation (see the nsExec::
    ; ExecToLog call above) always passes --flat-installer-layout, under
    ; which adapt_flat_installer_layout (civiccast/native/upgrade/seams.py)
    ; makes read_junction/lay_tree/flip_junction no-ops over the single
    ; "$INSTDIR\runtime" tree this bootstrap already extracted the NEW
    ; payload into BEFORE the engine ran, so under that layout a ROLLED_BACK
    ; report leaves the NEW code sitting in $INSTDIR\runtime regardless of
    ; what caused the rollback. On real hardware (Gate A run 33681670855, kit
    ; 7971815, beta.2 -> beta.3) the old DetailPrint-only branch let setup
    ; fall through to D4, which provisioned, activated, and registered/
    ; started the service on that mismatched new-code/old-schema pair, so the
    ; box ended the run serving 500s under a NOTICE-only log with exit code 0.
    ;
    ; WHAT CAUSED IT is deliberately NOT named in the operator text below.
    ; Exit 10 (ROLLED_BACK) is reached from orchestrator._drive_forward's
    ; single funnel (`except Exception as exc: return _rollback(journal,
    ; seams, reason=str(exc), attempting=attempting)`) -- ANY operational step
    ; can raise into it: drain/quiesce, the pre-upgrade backup/restore-drill
    ; (the Gate A run 33681670855 root cause, but only ONE of several
    ; possible causes), migrate, or the post-migration health gate. An
    ; earlier draft of this message named the backup check specifically;
    ; that was wrong for every other funneled cause. The real, specific
    ; reason lives in two places an operator or support engineer can read:
    ; upgrade-engine.log (which __main__.py now appends `outcome.journal.
    ; error` to, not just the bare phase name -- see that file's outcome-
    ; logging fix in the same PR) and the full journal at
    ; upgrade-journal.json beside it. The runtime-generated
    ; UPGRADE-RECOVERY.md doc (cited by exit 20/CIVICCAST_EXIT_D3_HALTED
    ; below) is NOT cited here: orchestrator.py only ever writes it from
    ; _halt, i.e. on HALTED_RESTORE_FAILED (exit 20) -- it does not exist for
    ; a plain ROLLED_BACK, and citing a file that is not there would be
    ; exactly the kind of unverified claim this codebase's own audit
    ; protocol forbids.
    ;
    ; So: fail closed here. CIVICCAST_FAIL aborts before any D4 step runs --
    ; the service is never registered or started on the new payload. The
    ; previous version's DATABASE is intact regardless of which step
    ; funneled into this rollback: a pre-mutation failure never touched it,
    ; and a post-mutation failure only reaches ROLLED_BACK (rather than
    ; HALTED_RESTORE_FAILED) once _rollback's own restore of the pre-upgrade
    ; backup has already succeeded (civiccast.native.upgrade.orchestrator.

  ; K1 FIX: FLAT-LAYOUT STATION ACTIVATION
  ; ===================================================================
  ; The ONLY writer of station-set.json / activation-self-test.json in this
  ; codebase (native_activation.rs::activate_flat_station_with, reusing the
  ; same composition/atomic-write machinery stage_distribution_with's
  ; versioned counterpart already uses) had no production caller anywhere in
  ; this hook chain (K1 audit, 2026-08-16) -- so a freshly registered,
  ; started CivicCastSupervisor service could never find station-set.json at
  ; $INSTDIR and stayed permanently in the (gracefully degraded, but never
  ; activated) NativeStationNotActivatedError state. This step closes that
  ; gap: it writes both files DIRECTLY at $INSTDIR (flat, no app/<version>
  ; subdirectory) -- the shape native/station_runtime.py::
  ; load_native_station_environment requires for a station whose service is
  ; registered against $INSTDIR\runtime\python.exe (see that macro's own
  ; header comment two steps below).
  ;
  ; Sources a signed station bundle, verified through
  ; native_distribution::acquire_station_distribution -- reused verbatim via
  ; --civiccast-import-station, never a second, forked acquisition path.
  ;
  ; TWO SOURCES, resolved in this order (2026-09-02 owner decision, "make
  ; sure the installer always HAS that index, even when downloaded alone"):
  ;
  ;   (a) "$EXEDIR\station\station-index.json" -- the USB-kit side-load next
  ;       to setup.exe. The SAME "packs next to the installer" convention
  ;       --civiccast-stage-packs already uses above for component packs,
  ;       extended to a full station bundle (a signed index plus its own
  ;       packs). assemble-native-beta-kit publishes exactly this layout, so
  ;       an air-gapped station installing from the stick keeps behaving
  ;       EXACTLY as before this branch: the kit copy wins, its packs sit
  ;       beside it in the same directory, and no cache round-trip happens.
  ;
  ;   (b) "$INSTDIR\station\station-index.json" -- the EMBEDDED copy. The
  ;       tiny signed index plus the tiny `core` pack (~1.5 KB; `core`'s
  ;       payload is a placeholder NOTICE, never runtime bytes -- see
  ;       scripts/build_native_station_bundle.py::_core_placeholder_sources)
  ;       ship inside setup.exe as Tauri bundle.resources and are laid down
  ;       at $INSTDIR\station\ before this hook runs. This is what makes a
  ;       DOWNLOAD-ONLY install/upgrade of setup.exe alone work: the ~21 GB
  ;       of model packs the index names are then satisfied from the per-SHA
  ;       cache under --cache-root rather than from the media directory
  ;       (native_distribution.rs::copy_station_pack_to_cache).
  ;       bundle.resources still carries ONLY these two tiny files plus the
  ;       VC++ prerequisite -- no embedded multi-gigabyte payload, ever; the
  ;       resource map is a hard gate in
  ;       scripts/build_native_bootstrap.py::validate_native_bootstrap_config.
  ;
  ; Fails loud only when NEITHER exists. An unconditional silent skip here
  ; is the exact shape that produced K1 in the first place (an install that
  ; reports success while the station can never activate), so the fail-closed
  ; branch stays -- it just can no longer fire merely because the operator
  ; downloaded setup.exe on its own.
  ;
  ; Written as two literal nsExec invocations rather than one invocation
  ; over a computed path register: every $R0-$R3 register live across this
  ; point still holds D3/D4 chain state (see the D3 rehoming note above and
  ; CIVICCAST_STEP's own register notes), and $0-$9 are unusable inside a
  ; CIVICCAST_STEP breadcrumb argument. Two literals cost a duplicated line

  ; QuietUninstallString registration (P1, 2026-07-31 run-18 forensic
  ; diagnosis): makes the SetErrorLevel 82 uninstall refusal in
  ; NSIS_HOOK_PREUNINSTALL (see that macro) actually REACHABLE by an
  ; unattended caller (winget, Intune, a deployment script).
  ; ===================================================================
  ; MEASURED, not assumed: Tauri's own generated installer.nsi (this file's
  ; own !include site) registers ONLY UninstallString (installer.nsi:676,
  ; `"$INSTDIR\uninstall.exe"`, no `_?=` and no QuietUninstallString) and
  ; never writes a QuietUninstallString key anywhere in that file (confirmed
  ; by reading target/release/nsis/x64/installer.nsi in full -- grep for
  ; "QuietUninstallString" there returns nothing). With no `_?=`, NSIS's own
  ; exehead behavior (confirmed live by this product's makensis probe,
  ; .agent-runs/native-windows/ws5-installer/evidence/nsis-errorlevel-probe/)
  ; is: the invoked "$INSTDIR\uninstall.exe" process respawns a copy of
  ; itself into %TEMP%, launches THAT copy to do the real work, and the
  ; ORIGINAL process -- the one any waiting caller actually holds a handle
  ; to and reads the exit code from -- returns 0 as soon as the respawn is
  ; launched. That original-process exit therefore happens BEFORE
  ; NSIS_HOOK_PREUNINSTALL, the Uninstall section body, or this file's own
  ; SetErrorLevel 82 refusal (see that macro's header) ever run in the
  ; respawned copy. A caller driving UninstallString synchronously always
  ; observes exit 0, even on a refused or failed uninstall -- the exact
  ; unreachable-refusal defect this fix closes.
  ;
  ; `_?=$INSTDIR` disables that respawn: the uninstaller runs IN-PLACE,
  ; synchronously, in the SAME process the caller is waiting on, so its real
  ; exit code (including the 82 refusal) becomes observable. This is the
  ; documented NSIS tradeoff for `_?=` (it also means the uninstaller cannot
  ; self-delete -- see the P2 fix in NSIS_HOOK_POSTUNINSTALL below, which
  ; closes that side of the same tradeoff).
  ;
  ; Registered as QuietUninstallString, NOT an overwrite of UninstallString:
  ; Windows' own Apps & Features interactive "Uninstall" button reads
  ; UninstallString and must keep the normal (self-deleting, respawning)
  ; behavior for a human-driven uninstall; QuietUninstallString is the
  ; distinct, silent-caller-specific key that modern unattended deployment
  ; tooling (winget, Intune, System Center) prefers when present, leaving

  ; (`civiccast/installer/router.py`'s `_require_local_setup_request`), so

  ; and section if either is missing) that needs no icon resource and no
  ; target executable to resolve -- both matter here, because this
  ; installer embeds exactly one icon (icons/icon.ico, used only for the
  ; installer/uninstaller binaries themselves per tauri.native.conf.json)
  ; and the shortcut's target is a URL, not a file on this machine. Windows
  ; opens a .url file in the system's default browser at click time,
  ; whatever that is.
  ;
  ; SetShellVarContext all: matches this product's fixed perMachine install

  ;
  ; Best-effort, deliberately: unlike every CIVICCAST_FAIL step above, a
  ; shortcut that could not be written does not abort or alarm the
  ; install -- the station itself is fully installed and functional either
  ; way, and the operator can still reach both surfaces via the setup
  ; wizard's own finish screen. ClearErrors/${If} ${Errors} only logs a

  ; BLOCKER fix (2026-07-30 Sandbox audit; moved from POSTUNINSTALL): the
  ; teardown CLI invokes "$INSTDIR\CivicCast Native.exe" itself -- but
  ; Tauri's generated uninstall Section deletes that exact file
  ; (installer.nsi:756, `Delete "$INSTDIR\${MAINBINARYNAME}.exe"`) BEFORE
  ; NSIS_HOOK_POSTUNINSTALL ever runs (installer.nsi:838, the
  ; `!insertmacro NSIS_HOOK_POSTUNINSTALL` call site). A teardown call left
  ; in POSTUNINSTALL can therefore never execute the exe it depends on --
  ; nsExec::ExecToLog just fails to launch a file that no longer exists --
  ; so the service was never stopped, the firewall rule was never removed,
  ; and the registry state was never cleared, while the uninstall still
  ; reported exit 0 (Sandbox run 7 live evidence: CivicCastSupervisor still
  ; registered, the TCP 8000 firewall rule still open, 12,145 files left
  ; behind).
  ;
  ; EVIDENCE the exe still exists at THIS point: NSIS_HOOK_PREUNINSTALL is
  ; inserted at installer.nsi:748-750, strictly BEFORE the Delete at
  ; installer.nsi:756 -- and the ownership preflight call two blocks above
  ; (in this same macro, running strictly before this point) already
  ; depends on and successfully invokes that exact exe, proving it is still
  ; present here.
  ;
  ; ORDERING (deliberate): runs AFTER the ownership preflight above --
  ; including its MB_YESNO prompt and BOTH Abort paths (decline, and a
  ; failed post-acknowledgment transfer) -- because a cancelled or failed
  ; uninstall must still be able to abort the WHOLE operation before any
  ; state is torn down; tearing the service down and THEN aborting would
  ; leave a station broken by a cancelled operation. Runs BEFORE the
  ; pre-existing taskkill below, for the same reason the ownership preflight
  ; already runs before taskkill: the running process should be asked to
  ; tear itself down cleanly (stop its own service, remove its own firewall
  ; rule) before anything forces it to exit.
  ;
  ; The recursive removal of $INSTDIR\runtime / $INSTDIR\packs / $INSTDIR
  ; itself STAYS in POSTUNINSTALL (it must run after Tauri's own file
  ; deletion there, which only happens after this Section's Uninstall body
  ; runs past this hook) -- see that macro. Its exit code is carried there

  ; used to be recorded here and the uninstall ALLOWED TO CONTINUE, with the
  ; refusal deferred to NSIS_HOOK_POSTUNINSTALL's tree-retention gate. That
  ; ordering is unrecoverable, and run 17 proved it on a live machine:
  ;
  ;   * PREUNINSTALL records exit 82 (service stop could not be confirmed);
  ;   * Tauri's generated uninstall Section then deletes
  ;     "$INSTDIR\CivicCast Native.exe" (installer.nsi:756) and the uninstaller
  ;     itself, plus the shortcuts and the Add/Remove Programs entry;
  ;   * only THEN does POSTUNINSTALL (installer.nsi:838) refuse to remove the
  ;     trees.
  ;
  ; The machine is left with a preserved multi-gigabyte tree, a still-running
  ; service, and NO product exe and NO uninstaller -- so neither
  ; --civiccast-repair nor a second Uninstall can be run, and the former
  ; PREINSTALL policy (exit 120, which keyed on that exact exe and on the
  ; still-registered service) then refused every future install.
  ; A retention gate whose own precondition destroys the tools needed to act on
  ; it is not fail-closed; it is a dead end.
  ;
  ; Fix: refuse HERE, before anything is deleted. Same shape as this macro's
  ; ownership-preflight refusal branches above (CIVICCAST_ALERT + SetErrors +
  ; Abort) -- not CIVICCAST_FAIL, which is the POSTINSTALL failure vocabulary
  ; and carries a SetErrorLevel from the install-side code table. Aborting from
  ; PREUNINSTALL leaves the machine FULLY INTACT: exe, uninstaller, ARP entry,
  ; service, and trees all still present, so the operator can stop the service
  ; and run Uninstall again, and every code path that ever cleans this machine
  ; still exists.
  ;
  ; ALL nonzero codes abort, not just 82. POSTUNINSTALL's narrower gate (82
  ; refuses tree removal; a generic 80 does not) was correct for the question
  ; IT answers -- "is deleting the trees dangerous?" -- because a leftover
  ; firewall rule is no reason to strand gigabytes. This gate answers a
  ; different question: "did the uninstall do what it said?" A teardown that
  ; failed to remove the service or the firewall rule did not, and continuing
  ; would delete the only exe that can retry it. Nothing is stranded by
  ; refusing here, because nothing has been removed yet.
  ;
  ; POSTUNINSTALL's gate STAYS as defense in depth: it still runs on the exit-0
  ; path, still fails closed on an unset Var, and still covers a hand-edited or
  ; foreign hook file where this Abort was not reached.

    ; no-op on the `_?=` path because the running exe cannot delete itself
    ; and a non-empty directory containing it cannot be removed by a plain

    ; hits the exact same wall for the same reason: `_?=` keeps
    ; uninstall.exe running from inside $INSTDIR for the whole duration of

    ; F-01, UNINSTALLER HALF (2026-08-01 sandbox newcomer re-walk dd7f835f):
    ; a completed uninstall must leave NOTHING claiming a product is
    ; installed. Two things make that claim. The first is
    ; HKLM\Software\CivicCast\Native\InstalledVersion, now cleared by the
    ; teardown CLI's "clear install markers" step
    ; (native_service_registration::delete_native_install_marker_values) --
    ; that one is what the re-walk actually caught, and it is what made the
    ; next install run the D3 upgrade engine against a product that was not
    ; there. The second is this one: Tauri's InstallDirRegKey.
    ;
    ; Tauri derives NSIS's ${MANUFACTURER} from the bundle identifier's
    ; second segment when no explicit publisher is configured --
    ; tauri.native.conf.json's "org.civiccast.native" -> "civiccast", which
    ; is also why this product's Publisher renders lowercase -- so the key is
    ; Software\civiccast\CivicCast (Native) and its DEFAULT VALUE is the
    ; install path. It is what Tauri's own reinstall page reads to decide a
    ; machine is "Already Installed".
    ;
    ; Tauri's generated uninstall Section does emit its own DeleteRegKey for
    ; this key, and this removal is deliberately REDUNDANT with it rather
    ; than a replacement -- DeleteRegKey on an absent key is a silent no-op,
    ; so the redundancy costs nothing. It is here because that expectation
    ; has already failed once in this product family: the retired WSL
    ; product's hook file (nsis-hooks.nsh, removed under the owner's "no
    ; linux" decision) carried an explicit "rc13 lifecycle repair" doing
    ; exactly this deletion for its own InstallDirRegKey, with the comment
    ; "Leaving it behind after uninstall produces a false 'Already Installed'
    ; page on an otherwise clean host".
    ;
    ; PLACEMENT is load-bearing, not cosmetic: inside the ${Else} arm of the
    ; $R2 tree-retention gate, so it runs ONLY on the path that actually
    ; removed $INSTDIR\runtime / $INSTDIR\packs / $INSTDIR. On the retained-
    ; tree path (service stop unconfirmed) the product IS still installed and
    ; this key must keep saying so -- erasing it there would let the next
    ; install run straight over a live tree, which is the same class of
    ; defect as the leftover this block removes, pointed the other way.
    ;
    ; /ifempty on the parent Software\civiccast is DELIBERATELY NOT DONE:
    ; the registry is case-insensitive, so that is the SAME key as
    ; HKLM\Software\CivicCast, which holds the ActiveRuntime selector and the
    ; Maintenance interlock blob this file's own postclear protocol above
    ; owns end to end. /ifempty would be a no-op while those exist and a
    ; cross-protocol surprise the moment they do not.

  ; remains a separate, typed operator action in the lifecycle implementation,
  ; not something a normal uninstall ever performs.

  ; Start Menu + Desktop shortcut removal (bug fix, field report 2026-08-28,
  ; candidate 9d4477b): the counterpart to POSTINSTALL's shortcut creation
  ; above. Deliberately OUTSIDE the $R2 tree-retention gate above (runs
  ; unconditionally, on EVERY uninstall, even one that skipped removing
  ; $INSTDIR because the supervisor service could not be confirmed stopped):
  ; unlike the runtime/packs trees, a Start Menu or Desktop shortcut is
  ; state this product owns independently of $INSTDIR and of whether the
  ; service is still running -- deleting a shortcut file carries none of
  ; the "still-running process holding the tree open" hazard that gate
  ; exists to guard against, so there is no safety reason to withhold it on
  ; that path, and every reason not to: a shortcut surviving a failed
  ; uninstall would point an operator at a station this machine may no
  ; longer be running as a service at all.
