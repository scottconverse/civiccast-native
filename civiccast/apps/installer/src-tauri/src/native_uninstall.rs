//! Native/WSL uninstall ownership policy and the Windows preflight adapter.
//!
//! Registry observations are direct Win32 registry calls: localized `reg.exe`
//! output is never parsed. The sole-active marker is not a selector mutation;
//! it is a product-owned proof consumed by NSIS only after the uninstaller has
//! completed its normal removal work.
//!
//! ## WSL ARP probe: elevated per-machine uninstall and other-user hives
//!
//! The WSL product's uninstall registration is a per-user (`HKEY_CURRENT_USER`)
//! ARP entry. When the Native uninstaller runs elevated for a per-machine
//! removal, `HKEY_CURRENT_USER` resolves to the *elevating admin's* hive, not
//! necessarily the hive of the user who installed WSL. To avoid misclassifying
//! a different user's still-installed WSL product as absent, the probe also
//! enumerates `HKEY_USERS` and checks every other loaded user hive.
//!
//! `HKEY_USERS` only exposes hives that are currently **loaded** — i.e. the
//! profiles of users who are logged on (or otherwise mounted) at probe time.
//! A per-user WSL install belonging to a user who is not logged in is
//! invisible to this probe and is indistinguishable from a true absence; see
//! [`WSL_ARP_PROBE_LOADED_HIVES_ONLY`]. Mounting `NTUSER.DAT` for unloaded
//! profiles, or reconciling against `C:\Users`, is a deliberate policy
//! decision reserved for the coordinator and is intentionally NOT implemented
//! here — this module only widens visibility to hives Windows has already
//! loaded, and fails closed (`Unknown`, which blocks uninstall) whenever the
//! `HKEY_USERS` enumeration itself fails or any probed view errors with
//! anything other than "not found".

/// writers were the WSL lane (`cutover-to-wsl`), the operator-run
/// `civiccast-runtime cutover-to-native` verb, D5 repair, and uninstall
/// bookkeeping -- a plain native install wrote it NEVER. So a freshly
/// installed native station had `selector=absent`, and `decide`'s step 4 then
/// depends entirely on `detect_wsl_install()`, which is a deliberate
/// TRI-STATE: on a machine where `wsl.exe` is the OS inbox stub and the
/// SCM WSL-service query is ambiguous it answers `None` (unknown), and the
/// guard correctly refuses to invent an authority basis --
/// `blocked_probe_unavailable`, control plane never starts. That fail-closed
/// behavior is CORRECT and is unchanged here. What was missing is the other
/// half: a native install must produce the selector it is asking the guard to
/// honor.
///
/// ## Why the table looks like `decide_selector_repair_action` but is not it
///
/// Repair (`native_repair::decide_selector_repair_action`) treats `Absent` as
/// a legitimate settled state and never touches it, because repair has no new
/// information -- it is only cleaning up corruption. An INSTALL does have new
/// information: the native product is being installed, elevated, right now.
/// That is a genuine ownership event, so `Absent` is the one cell an install
/// may legitimately write -- and only when `probe_wsl_arp` independently
/// proves the CivicCast WSL product is not registered, so the write cannot
/// silently take a machine away from a WSL install that was there first.
/// Every other cell is left exactly as found:
///
/// | selector     | WSL product    | action                     |

            REVERSING the 2026-07-30 coordinator decision that preserved this \
            value: the re-walk read this live PostgreSQL password verbatim out \
            of the registry of a machine the product had already been \
            uninstalled from. Preserving product DATA under \
            %PROGRAMDATA%\\CivicCast was never a decision to leave a live \
            SECRET behind -- data is preserved; credentials are not. \
            DISCLOSED CONSEQUENCE, deliberately not hidden: the preserved \
            PostgreSQL cluster can no longer be reused by a reinstall, because \
            the password cannot be reconstructed from anything on disk. \
            civiccast.native.provision's decision matrix classifies that as \
            FAIL_LOUD_MISSING_REGISTRY and refuses rather than regenerating a \
            password the cluster would reject -- correct fail-closed behavior, \
            but it means uninstall-then-reinstall over preserved data needs \
            operator recovery. Re-establishing a credential for a surviving, \
            product-owned cluster is a separate, still-open unit of work",
