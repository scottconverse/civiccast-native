//! D4 install-side state establishment for CivicCast (Native):
//! `spec-installer-lifecycle.md` D1/D4 ("registers a LocalSystem service");
//! D4 ("Exact state inventory (files, registry keys, service, firewall
//! rules) is enumerated in the spec's implementation and asserted by the
//! proofs -- 'everything gone' means that inventory, bidirectionally.");
//! `spec-supervisor.md` AC-S1 ("installer/service creates the required
//! inbound rules (portal/API ports); proven by netsh dump...").
//!
//! ## Service registration: invoke the pywin32 seam, do not rebuild it
//!
//! `Cargo.toml` carries neither the `windows-service` crate nor `windows`/
//! `winapi` (checked before writing this module) -- per the task instruction
//! this would ordinarily mean STOP and report options rather than add a
//! dependency unilaterally. A third option was found that needs no new Rust
//! dependency at all: `civiccast/native/supervisor/service_host.py` already
//! defines the production `ServiceFramework` subclass
//! (`CivicCastSupervisorService`, with `_svc_name_`, `_svc_display_name_`,
//! `_svc_description_` set from `civiccast.native.supervisor.config`/
//! `civiccast.native.supervisor.service.SERVICE_DESCRIPTION`) and exposes
//! `main()`, which calls `win32serviceutil.HandleCommandLine`. That pywin32
//! entry point already implements exactly the registration contract D4/D5
//! need: `install` creates the service (LocalSystem by default when no
//! `--username` is given -- `.venv/Lib/site-packages/win32/lib/
//! win32serviceutil.py:846-862`); if the service already exists
//! (`ERROR_SERVICE_EXISTS`) it falls through to `update`
//! (`win32serviceutil.py:866-868`), i.e. install-or-update is ALREADY
//! idempotent (D5 Repair's "re-register service" and this task's "re-run
//! over existing state = clean replace" are satisfied by the seam itself,
//! not by logic this module adds). This module's job is therefore the same
//! shape as the D3 engine invocation already in `nsis-hooks-native.nsh`
//! (`"$INSTDIR\runtime\python.exe" -m civiccast.native.upgrade ...`): build
//! the argv for `python.exe -m civiccast.native.supervisor.service_host
//! install --startup auto` and run it, never re-typing the service's name/
//! display name/description in Rust (those live in the Python class and are
//! read automatically by pywin32's `InstallService`).
//!
//! **Recovery actions and service description are handled differently, per
//! the task's explicit "if the spec doesn't pin a value, STOP and report
//! rather than inventing" instruction:**
//! - **Description** is already pinned (`service.py:157-161`,
//!   `SERVICE_DESCRIPTION`) and applied automatically by the seam above --
//!   no gap.
//! - **Start type** is not literally pinned anywhere, but `spec-supervisor.md`
//!   AC1 ("Boot, no login: children ready in D6 order...") is only
//!   satisfiable by `SERVICE_AUTO_START` -- `SERVICE_DEMAND_START` would
//!   contradict an unconditional "boot, no login" acceptance criterion. This
//!   is a necessary derivation from a stated AC, not an invented value; see
//!   [`SERVICE_STARTUP_MODE`].
//! - **Recovery actions** (SCM restart-on-crash: delay, count, reset period)
//!   have NO pinned numeric parameters anywhere in the read set (grepped
//!   `.agent-runs/native-windows` for `ResetPeriod|SC_ACTION_RESTART|
//!   recovery action|restart delay` -- zero hits). `spec-supervisor.md` AC4
//!   ("Kill the SUPERVISOR mid-playout... SCM restarts it...") pins the
//!   qualitative behavior (restart-on-failure), but pywin32's
//!   `win32serviceutil` helpers never call `ChangeServiceConfig2` with
//!   `SERVICE_CONFIG_FAILURE_ACTIONS` (grepped
//!   `.venv/Lib/site-packages/win32/lib/win32serviceutil.py` -- zero hits),
//!   so AC4 requires an explicit `sc.exe failure` call -- the SCM default is
//!   NO recovery (a crashed service stays dead), which would fail AC4 at the
//!   lifecycle matrix. **RESOLVED (coder decision, 2026-07-29, same-day
//!   follow-up):** the numeric parameters are coder-pinnable implementation
//!   detail, not owner scope -- pinned to the industry-standard restart
//!   ladder 5 s / 10 s / 30 s with a daily failure-count reset, plus
//!   `failureflag 1` so nonzero-exit stops recover like crashes. See
//!   `service_failure_actions_command`/`service_failure_flag_command`.
//!
//! ## DatabaseUrl
//!
//! `civiccast.native.provision.models.resolve_database_url` is "the
//! documented seam" (task instruction) that produces the exact string value;
//! this module never reconstructs the `postgresql://...` format itself
//! (`build_database_url`'s percent-encoding is not duplicated here). What
//! this module owns is the D4 half: writing an ALREADY-RESOLVED value to
//! `HKLM\SOFTWARE\CivicCast\Native\DatabaseUrl` and reading it back to
//! verify the write landed, the same style as `native_uninstall.rs`'s
//! `write_postclear_marker`. [`write_database_url`] is implemented and
//! unit-tested for its own contract (write + read-back verify, given a
//! value).
//!
//! **RESOLVED (WP2 provision-execution wiring, 2026-07-29): the caller now
//! exists.** [`run_native_provision`] shells to the journaled Python
//! provisioning engine (`civiccast.native.provision`, landed separately),
//! which generates the password, runs `run_provision` against its REAL
//! seams (real `initdb`, real filesystem under ProgramData), and hands the
//! resolved `DatabaseUrl` back through a SINGLE stdout marker line
//! ([`PROVISION_HANDOFF_MARKER_PREFIX`], parsed by
//! [`parse_provision_handoff`]) -- never printed by this process, never
//! placed on a second CLI subprocess's argv, and written to HKLM via an
//! IN-PROCESS call straight into the existing [`write_database_url`]. A
//! handoff-less success means the Python side took its no-op path (existing
//! cluster + existing registry value both already correct) and never
//! generated a password to begin with -- see
//! `civiccast.native.provision.__main__`'s `ProvisionCliAction` decision
//! matrix. Wired into `NSIS_HOOK_POSTINSTALL` between the D2
//! re-verification gates and D4 service/firewall registration (see
//! `nsis-hooks-native.nsh`); the STOP this doc previously recorded here is
//! closed. What remains genuinely open (documented in the WP2 evidence
//! file, not invented): where an extracted server-binaries pack physically
//! lands on disk has no earlier-established convention, so
//! `civiccast.native.provision.__main__.resolve_provision_paths` picks one
//! (`<install_root>\packs\native-server-binaries\...`) as a disclosed coder
//! decision, not a spec-pinned value.
//!
//! ## Firewall
//!
//! AC-S1's "portal/API ports" (plural) resolves to exactly ONE port, not two:
//! `main.rs`'s `OPERATOR_CONSOLE_URL`/`RESIDENT_PORTAL_URL`/`SERVICE_URL`/
//! `SERVICE_HEALTH_ADDR` and `civiccast.native.supervisor.core.py`'s
//! `control_plane_port` default all agree on `8000` -- the resident portal,
//! operator console, and control-plane API are the SAME FastAPI listener on
//! one port, distinguished by URL path, not port number. No second port
//! value appears anywhere in the read set. `netsh advfirewall firewall show
//! rule` returns exit code 0 whether or not a rule was found (existence is
//! signalled only by the "No rules match the specified criteria." string in
//! stdout, a documented `netsh.exe` quirk) -- [`classify_firewall_probe_output`]
//! classifies captured output rather than trusting the exit code, and fails
//! CLOSED (`Unknown` -> `Block`) on any output shape it does not recognize,
//! so an ambiguous probe can never silently skip OR silently duplicate the
//! rule.

// else: it does not start the service now, and no `StartService`/`sc start`
// call existed anywhere under `src-tauri/src/` (grepped before writing this).
// A freshly installed station therefore had a correctly registered, correctly
// configured, entirely STOPPED service -- no postgres, no control
// plane on 127.0.0.1:8000, and so nothing behind the installer's "Open
// operator console" button -- until the operator happened to reboot.
//
// DELIBERATELY NOT PUT INSIDE `register_native_service`: that function is
// ALSO the D5 Repair path (`native_repair.rs::reregister_service_and_firewall`),
// and repair's own documented decision is that it must NOT restart a service
// it stopped to rebuild a tree ("starting a service an operator stopped on
// purpose is its own defect" -- see `ServiceQuiescenceAuthority::
// stopped_for_rebuild`, which prints an explicit NOTE saying the station was
// left down). Starting from inside `register_native_service` would silently
// make that NOTE a false statement. The start is therefore sequenced by the
// D4 INSTALL CLI (`main.rs::run_native_service_registration_cli`) only.
//

// construction and exit-code classification are pure and unit-tested; the

// Registry key ACL hardening (municipal-shared-PC security fix, 2026-07-30).
//
// Audit finding, independently re-verified with measured ACLs on a real
// Windows 11 box: `create_subkey_with_flags` below creates
// `HKLM\SOFTWARE\CivicCast\Native` with NO security descriptor of its own,
// so it INHERITS `HKLM\SOFTWARE`'s default DACL -- under which
// `BUILTIN\Users` has `ReadKey`. `DatabaseUrl` holds the plaintext
// `postgresql://user:PASSWORD@host/db` connection string, so any ordinary
// local user on the shared station can read the production PostgreSQL
// credential straight out of the registry. On a municipal shared PC "another
// user of the same machine" is a realistic threat, not a hypothetical one.
//
// WHO ACTUALLY NEEDS ACCESS (investigated before restricting, per the fix
// task's explicit caution -- this must not break the running product):
// * The only WRITER is this installer process itself, which already runs
//   elevated (NSIS install/repair always requests admin) -- confirmed by
//   `write_database_url`'s own caller chain (`run_native_provision`, invoked
//   from `NSIS_HOOK_POSTINSTALL`) and by `nsis-hooks-bootstrap.nsh`'s
//   `ReadRegStr`/`--civiccast-provision` call sites, all inside the
//   already-elevated installer.
// * The only READER found anywhere in this codebase is the SAME installer,
//   reading its own prior write back (`ReadRegStr $R2/$R3 HKLM
//   "Software\CivicCast\Native" "DatabaseUrl"` in `nsis-hooks-bootstrap.nsh`)
//   to decide NOOP/FAIL_LOUD/RUN before a repair or reinstall.
// * `civiccast.native.supervisor.service.py` (the LocalSystem supervisor
//   service, ADR-0021 -- see `native\supervisor\control_client.py`'s "the
//   supervisor runs as LocalSystem" comment) reads its PostgreSQL
//   credential from the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable, NOT from this
//   registry key directly (grepped `civiccast/native` for
//   `SOFTWARE.{0,3}CivicCast.{0,3}Native` and `winreg`/`QueryValueEx` against
//   this exact key: zero hits outside the installer/provisioning modules
//   already named above). There is therefore no non-admin, non-LocalSystem
//   runtime component that needs to read this key -- restricting it to
//   SYSTEM + Administrators cannot break the running product.
//
// FIX: restrict the key's own DACL to SYSTEM + BUILTIN\Administrators full
// control, PROTECTED (inheritance disabled) so `HKLM\SOFTWARE`'s
// world-readable default DACL can never flow back in on a future
// `RegOpenKey`/reboot/GPO refresh. Same SDDL shape the Python side already
// uses for its own SYSTEM+Administrators-only kernel objects
// (`civiccast.native.runtime_guard.MUTEX_SDDL` ==
// `"D:P(A;;GA;;;SY)(A;;GA;;;BA)"`), reused here for cross-language
// consistency of "what SYSTEM+Administrators-only means in this codebase".
//
// Applied in the code that CREATES the key
// (`write_database_url`, every call -- idempotent and self-healing rather
// than a separate script an operator has to remember to run), not as a
// standalone remediation tool.
//
// No `windows`/`winapi` crate was already a dependency of this crate (see
// the module doc's "Service registration" section for why one was avoided
// there); `RegSetKeySecurity`/`RegGetKeySecurity` and the SDDL conversion
// functions are not exposed by the `winreg` crate itself, so this is a
// disclosed coder decision to add `windows-sys` as a DIRECT dependency --
// pinned to 0.59, the exact version `winreg 0.55` already pulls in
// transitively (see `Cargo.lock`), so this resolves against an
// already-vendored version rather than fetching a new one.

/// disabled (`P`). Identical DACL shape to
