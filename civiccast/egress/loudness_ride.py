"""U25 -- the speech-leveling ride that runs INSTEAD OF loudnorm before playout.

Why the conform stopped using ``loudnorm``
------------------------------------------
``loudnorm`` normalizes a program to its target *on average*.  A public meeting
is not stationary: a chair at the dais, a speaker who steps back from the
lectern, and an un-mic'd speaker at the public-comment mic can sit 15-20 LU
apart inside one recording, so a single whole-program gain necessarily lands
every four-minute stretch somewhere else.  The acceptance bar for a prepared
egress asset is therefore per-stretch, not per-program: **every 240 s window of
the emitted program, in both window families, must land inside
-16 +/- 1.0 LUFS**, with the whole program inside +/- 0.5 LU.  No built-in
FFmpeg leveler reaches that band (U25 rounds 1-2 measured ``dynaudnorm``,
``speechnorm``, ``compand``, ``loudnorm`` one-pass and two-pass, and chains of
them); a slow, speech-following gain ride does.

Shape of the ride
-----------------
::

    source decode (f32le, conformed rate)   ->  per-sample gain curve (pure)
                                            ->  numpy multiply, one chunk at a time
                                            ->  volume=<trim>dB, 4x upsample,
                                                alimiter=<true-peak ceiling>,
                                                4x downsample
                                            ->  AAC / MPEG-TS  (the audio the
                                                video pass then stream-copies)
                                            ->  emitted-true-peak guard: measure
                                                the artifact, re-emit once lower
                                                if it is hotter than -1.0 dBTP

Everything above the process boundary is a pure function of numbers, so the
rules that decide the gain -- the two-stage gate, the window curve, the silence
hold, the clamp, the gap cap, the slew limit, the correction, the sum, the
converge loop -- are all unit-testable without touching FFmpeg.  The process
entry points (:func:`build_source_series_args`, :func:`build_measure_sink_args`,
:func:`build_encode_sink_args`, :func:`build_artifact_measure_args`,
:func:`build_peak_scan_args`, :func:`build_reencode_args`,
:func:`build_video_from_source_args`) are pure argument builders too, so the
exact FFmpeg grammar is asserted in tests rather than described in prose.

Two-stage gate
--------------
The ride's own loudness arithmetic (:func:`gated_loudness`) is the EBU R128
two-stage gate that the *acceptance* measurement uses, so the ride and the gate
agree by construction rather than by calibration.

The converge loop
-----------------
The gain curve alone gets the program close but not to the bar: the limiter that
protects the emitted true peak is not an identity function, so a ride that
targets -16.0 LUFS emits somewhere near -16.5.  The loop therefore measures the
rendered result and corrects it, three passes per iteration:

``A``  the ride alone, with no trim and no limiter -> ``I_A``, which sets
       ``trim0 = TARGET - I_A`` (the trim that *would* be right if the limiter
       were transparent);
``B``  the ride with ``trim0`` -> ``I_B``, whose residual ``TARGET - I_B`` is
       the limiter's shortfall;
``C``  the ride with ``trim1 = trim0 + (TARGET - I_B) / max(slope, 0.4)``, where
       ``slope`` is the limiter's *measured* dB-per-dB from the previous
       iteration (``(I_C - I_B) / (trim1 - trim0)``).  The floor of 0.4 keeps a
       nearly-flat measured slope from launching the trim to infinity.

The loop stops when the emitted whole-program error is within
:data:`RideParams.stop_lu`, or when an iteration fails to improve on the
previous one, or at :data:`RideParams.max_iters`.  Then the correction curve --
``target - L_W(t)`` of what iteration ``C`` actually measured -- is summed into
the applied curve for the next iteration, and the gap cap is re-applied.

Measured effect (U25 Q12, 4D36 and BIG, the two cells round 5 failed): the
slope-corrected loop moved 4D36 from -0.700 to -0.1 LU and BIG from -0.600 to
+0.1 LU of whole-program error, while the worst 240 s window *improved* on both
(0.899 -> 0.513 and -> 0.289).  Round 5's plain ``trim1 = trim0 + err`` step is
what pinned them 0.6 LU low.

The output stage bounds the true peak, and the emit proves it
------------------------------------------------------------
``alimiter`` is a *sample*-peak limiter: it acts on the samples it is handed, so
on its own it cannot bound the inter-sample peaks an encoder will later create.
U25 Q14 measured the cost of that gap directly -- with a -3.0 dBFS sample-peak
ceiling, BIG's ride output sat at exactly -3.000 dBFS (true peak -0.8 dBTP) and
the emitted AAC still carried four frames above 0 dBFS (peak +2.754 dBFS,
emitted true peak +2.8 dBTP), i.e. essentially all of the reported true-peak
growth was the encoder's, and no sample-peak ceiling can prevent it.  So the
limiter is handed a 4x-oversampled copy of the signal (48 kHz -> 192 kHz, soxr,
precision 28), limits at ``-1.5 dBTP`` -- the value the incumbent
``loudnorm ... TP=-1.5`` conform promised -- and the result is decimated back to
the conformed rate before the AAC encode.

Oversampling makes the *pre*-AAC true peak bounded; it does not by itself make
the *artifact* compliant, because the codec's overshoot is its own -- U25 round 7
measured the limiter holding to +0.0034 dB over its own ceiling while the AAC
round trip added up to +3.27 dB, which is why a lowered ceiling does not buy a
proportionally lower emitted peak.  U43 then showed the overshoot is codec-side
rather than spectral -- a lowpass at the encoder's own cutoff moved the peak by
+0.00 dB -- so the only lever that reaches it is headroom at the encoder.  The
artifact therefore gets the last word, through the pure decision functions that
are this module's whole guard API: after an attempt's emit, the emitted true
peak, the loudness and the decoded sample peak are measured seek-free,
:func:`guard_pad_db` returns how far the one pad round moves -- headroom equal to
the measured overshoot plus :data:`TP_GUARD_PAD_MARGIN_DB`, capped at
:data:`TP_GUARD_MAX_PAD_DB`, with the drive raised by the same amount so the
programme loudness holds -- and :func:`select_leveled_attempt` picks which
attempt ships -- the loudness gates first, then the lowest decoded sample peak,
then the lowest emitted true peak, keeping the nominal attempt when nothing
separates them.

That round is a *re-encode*, not a re-convergence.  The ride PCM is already
correct, so the guard re-runs only the limiter, the codec and the mux, over the
bytes the nominal emit consumed -- ``run_ride``'s ``pcm_path`` tee retains them
(:func:`build_reencode_args`, :func:`run_reencode`) -- so every round costs
seconds, not a second full ride.  The emitted true peak is best effort at
:data:`TP_GUARD_TARGET_DBTP`; the *guarantee* is
:data:`TP_GUARD_MAX_PEAK_DBFS` -- no decoded sample above +0.1 dBFS -- and it is
measured on the artifact rather than promised by a ceiling, which is why an
artifact over it is *reported* rather than re-emitted: the selector keeps the best
attempt it has, and an over-bound one ships with an error line, because a channel
that airs a slightly hot artifact beats one that airs nothing.  U25's panel is
what settled that: BIG's nominal emit, the hottest artifact the panel produced,
sits at +0.0036 dBFS from one sample in 9000 s, and every attempt that tried to
fix it landed worse.  The caller owns the ride, the encode and the measurement
*policy*: :func:`level_window` is the one entry point here that spawns the passes
(a source series, the converge probes, one emit, the artifact's measurement, at
most one pad round and then the encoder variants while the bound is still
missed), and it does that only because the caller asked for a leveled
window by calling it -- every piece it spawns is a module function the caller
could have run itself.  It never logs: it returns a :class:`LeveledSelection`
whose ``warning`` the caller logs, and a ``round_error`` the caller logs beside
it.  The trigger rate and the time it costs are counted in the unit report.

The acceptance gate, ported
---------------------------
The station scores a published artifact by its own geometry -- 240 s windows
tiled from 0 s and from 120 s, each window's gated loudness within 0.9 LU of
target, the whole program within 0.5 LU -- so :func:`level_window` judges its
attempts by that same arithmetic rather than by "close enough": see
:func:`window_levels`, :func:`worst_window_deviation_lu` and
:func:`whole_program_err_lu`, and the ``LOUDNESS_*`` constants they are built
from.  The port is deliberately *unrounded*, where the harness rounds each
window's level and start to 3 dp for display, and it skips a window it cannot
measure rather than scoring it -- an unmeasurable window is not evidence of a
deviation.  The printed summary ``I`` is **not** the gate: it is a separate
quantity FFmpeg computes, the panel proved the two disagree, so
:attr:`LeveledAttempt.emitted_lufs` records it for the report while
``loudness_ok`` reads the series.

The gap cap is not a leveler for room tone
------------------------------------------
:func:`gap_cap` exists so the ride cannot lift a quiet room to target -- that is
how a meeting recording ends up sounding like a compressor pumping between
speakers.  It is kept, and it is known not to be sufficient: U25 measured a
``+13.698 dB`` lift on 4D36's quietest gap.  Recorded as a known beta.10
limitation rather than hidden; see the unit's report.

Failure is a degrade, never a channel outage
--------------------------------------------
Every failure inside the ride -- numpy absent, an FFmpeg that will not start, a
pass that exits non-zero or times out, an ebur128 series that cannot be parsed
-- raises :class:`LoudnessRideError`, which the preparer catches and turns into
ONE warning plus the pre-U25 single-pass ``loudnorm`` conform.  The channel
airs; only the leveling is missing.  This mirrors ``_measure_loudnorm_metadata``'s
existing degrade contract (U20), and a degraded artifact is never promoted into
the whole-asset conform cache.  Cancellation is not a failure: it raises
:class:`LoudnessRideCancelledError` and is re-raised as a shutdown signal.

       the one axis the guard can actually move;
    3. **the lowest emitted true peak** -- the guard's original purpose.

    Each level only breaks ties within the one above it.  There is no fourth
    level and no over-riding clause: the guard keeps the best attempt it has and
    the caller ships it, whether or not it clears the hard gate.  Answer 11's
    last resort did the opposite -- it over-rode a loudness-lawful keep with a
    quieter re-emit -- and U25's panel measured that artifact losing on every
    gated axis at once, which is the case this ordering exists to prevent.

    An unmeasurable attempt can never win an axis it has no measurement for: a
    peak nobody scanned is ``inf``, not zero, and the guard does not trade a
    measured artifact for an unmeasured one.  When no axis separates the attempts
    at all -- nothing measured -- the *nominal* attempt is kept, because a program
    that cannot be measured still airs.  Ties go to the earlier round, so the
    nominal ceiling keeps its claim whenever a lowered one is no better.

    U42 adds no axis here.  An encoder variant enters this function as one more
    attempt and is judged by these same three levels -- which is the whole point
    of the ordering: the variant round is not privileged, and it wins only by
    being lawful on loudness and colder on peak.  What U42 does add is the label
    in ``warning``: every attempt names its own encoder settings

    The whole of answer 12, in order: measure the source, converge the ride,
    emit once through the profile's codec, measure what was emitted, and then --
    only while the attempt that would be kept is still over the hard bound --
    spend re-encode rounds against the retained ride PCM.  The pad round comes
    first (answer 11's ceiling, U43's compensating drive; :func:`guard_pad_db`);
    if the kept attempt is *still* hot after it, the encoder variants
    (:data:`TP_GUARD_ENCODER_VARIANTS`, U42) follow in their fixed order, and the
    loop stops at the first attempt that is not over the bound.  All rounds read
    the same PCM and re-run only the limiter, the codec and the mux: no
    re-convergence, and no re-render of the curve.  The drive is the one thing a
    round may move, and only the pad round moves it.  That round first *measures*
    the settings it is about to spend: one extra limited pass over the source, at
    its own ceiling and drive, measuring rather than encoding.  (The ride's own
    render is the pass that can be pointed at another ceiling; the retained PCM is
    headerless raw f32, so the module's artifact measurement, which reads a media
    file, cannot score it.)  The drive is then corrected by the
    whole-program error that pass measured (:func:`guard_pad_trim_db`), because a
    lowered ceiling makes the limiter work harder and it then removes *less*
    loudness than the pad hands back (U43's sweep: +0.53 LU on one live cell,
    -0.28 LU on another).  Once, not to a fixed point: the guard owes the bound
    one round, not a converged level.  If that measuring pass dies, the round
    still ships at the uncorrected pad -- the bound is still owed.
    Then keep the best attempt (see
    :func:`select_leveled_attempt`) and make ``audio_path`` be it: the winning
    round is moved onto the caller's path, every losing one deleted, so the
    caller has one file to publish and no choice left to make.

    ``pcm_path`` is the tee of post-curve PCM the emit writes and the round
    reads.  The caller may supply one (it then owns the file and it outlives the
    call); otherwise the module makes its own, next to the artifact, and deletes
    it on the way out -- at 48 kHz stereo float32 that is ~23 MB per minute of
    program, so it is not a file to leave behind.

    Raises :class:`LoudnessRideError` when the source cannot be measured or the
    ride cannot converge -- the caller's cue to degrade to the pre-U25 conform.
    Cancellation raises :class:`LoudnessRideCancelledError` and is re-raised
    after the files this call owns are cleaned up.  A round that fails is not an
    error: it is reported in ``round_error`` and the nominal ships.

        # -0.28 LU quiet on another, so the residue is neither small nor fixed in
        # sign).  So the round measures the settings it is about to spend, at the
        # ceiling it will emit at, and corrects the drive by what it finds --
