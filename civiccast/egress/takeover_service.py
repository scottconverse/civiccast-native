"""Live-takeover orchestration (CivicCast 3.0 — S5).

Wires the proven engine primitives into a controllable, audited operation:

* **take** — build the live source plan, record a :class:`TakeoverSession`
  (open), and queue an ``EgressCommand(action="takeover")`` for the daemon
  (which calls ``supervisor.request_live_takeover``).
* **handback** — queue ``EgressCommand(action="handback")`` and close the
  session.
* **state** — the runtime :class:`ManualRouteState` (active session +
  can_takeover / can_return), derived from the audit store + live readiness.
* **audit** — the channel's takeover history.

The service touches no engine process directly; it persists + enqueues, and the
daemon consumes the commands (S5 daemon slice). ``clock`` / ``id_factory`` are
injectable for deterministic tests; ``ingest_plan_provider`` is injected so the
service stays decoupled from the live relay-config store.

WP-07 adds one more injected seam, ``readiness_verifier``, called in **take**
after the source plan is built and *before* the audit row is written or the
command is queued. Ordering is the whole point: an audit row is the station's
durable record that a takeover happened, and the queued command moves air as
soon as the daemon reads it, so neither may exist for a source that has gone
stale, started failing, or been edited since the operator's ingest plan was
built. See ``civiccast.live.readiness_service``.
