"""Gi-free control-command parsing for the playout worker (Windows + POSIX).

The per-channel worker reads newline-delimited commands from a control FIFO; this
parser is kept gi-free so it is unit-testable without GStreamer.

Two seamless mechanisms (both keep the persistent mux running — D-S1-6, never a
restart):

* ``swap <index>`` — switch the active source role among the *fixed* legs
  (program/slate/live). Drives the operator role controls (force-slate, live take).
* ``reload <path>`` — rebuild the *program* leg's content from a new serialized
  ``PlayoutGraph`` at ``<path>`` while output stays PLAYING. This is how the daemon
  applies a newly-due scheduled program without bouncing the encoder.
* ``caption <pts_ms> <dur_ms> <b64text>`` — push one timed-text caption cue into the
  live caption appsrc (S11a). The text is base64-encoded (the FIFO is newline-
  delimited and base64 has no spaces/newlines), so arbitrary caption text survives.

    Caption sidecars retain the source-audio timestamps.  The live appsrc cannot
    attach a cue to video buffers that already left the mux, so transport PTS is
    clamped to a small lead over the pipeline's current running time.

    A cue modestly ahead of the live edge keeps its original PTS.  A cue FAR
    ahead, however, is not genuinely "in the future" -- it is a timestamp from a
    different epoch.  The live tap numbers its audio segments by an ABSOLUTE
    program clock (``chunk_index * segment_seconds``), which keeps growing for
    the life of the station, while this appsrc's running time restarts with each
    worker.  Measured on Blackwell 2026-09-16: a real cue at 00:52:12 (3,132,120
    ms of program clock) was pushed against a pipeline running time of ~90 s, so
    the buffer was scheduled ~50.7 MINUTES ahead.  It could never reach the
    emitted stream inside the 6 s decode-back window, which is why the stream
    carried only A/53 null padding while the sidecar held a good cue.

    Anything beyond ``max_future_lead_ms`` is therefore rebased onto the live
    edge instead of preserved.  The bound is deliberately far larger than any
