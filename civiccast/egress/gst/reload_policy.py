"""Gi-free decision logic for seamless program-leg reloads (D-S1-6 / B3 fix).

Kept out of ``engine.py`` for the same reason ``decode_policy.py`` is: ``engine.py``
cannot be imported at all without ``gi`` + a real GStreamer install, so any logic
worth unit-testing on a bare checkout has to live in a sibling module the engine
imports rather than duplicates.

Two independent decisions live here, both born from the same soak defect
(Desktop/CIVICCAST-EVIDENCE/soak-120-4b30c99-20260904, kit 4b30c99): back-to-back
scheduled premieres EOS'd the GStreamer worker at every plan boundary because
nothing extended a live (ON_AIR) plan before it ran out.

1. **When to trigger a rollover reload.** A cold conform (``SourcePreparer``) can
   take minutes; triggering the reload only 30s before the live plan's projected
   end (the first cut of this fix) leaves the prepare step racing the pipeline's
   own EOS. ``rollover_trigger_at`` computes an EARLIER, boundary-aligned trigger
   time: the moment the plan's LAST segment begins, or ``min_lead_seconds`` before
   the plan's projected end -- whichever is earlier (the more conservative, i.e.
   earliest, of the two).

2. **Whether the engine may defer the selector switch to the outgoing leg's own
   EOS**, instead of cutting to the new leg the instant it is ready
   (``GstPlayoutEngine.reload_program``'s historic behavior). Triggering the
   rollover much earlier (per 1 above) means the new leg is typically ready WELL
   before the old leg's natural end; switching immediately on readiness would then
   TRUNCATE the tail of the still-airing item -- a regression worse than the
   EOS-restart this fix targets. Deferring the switch to the old leg's own EOS
   keeps the two legs mutually synchronized on the shared pipeline clock (both
   built from the same wall-clock join-in-progress offset) and lets the airing
   item finish naturally, with no re-decode and no jump.

   Deferring is safe ONLY for an automation-driven extension of an already-ON_AIR
   plan with no operator override in effect. An operator-initiated live takeover or
   forced slate is a deliberate "now" request -- see ``PlayoutSupervisor.
   request_live_takeover``/``request_fallback_slate`` (civiccast/egress/
   supervisor.py) -- and must still cut immediately, so ``should_defer_switch``
   returns False whenever a manual override is active, or the channel was not
   already ON_AIR (e.g. the FALLBACK_SLATE gap-replan reload, which issue #157
   requires to interrupt filler immediately, never wait for it to end).
