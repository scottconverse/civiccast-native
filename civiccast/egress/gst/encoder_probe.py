"""Decide whether a GStreamer encoder factory is a real hardware encoder.

Hardware encoders (``mfh264enc``, ``mfh265enc``, ``nvh264enc``, ...) report a
factory ``klass`` metadata string containing ``"/Hardware"`` (e.g.
``"Codec/Encoder/Video/Hardware"``). Software encoders (``openh264enc``,
``x264enc``, ...) do not. An absent factory returns no metadata at all.

The decision function below is pure and gi-free so it can be unit-tested
without a GStreamer install; ``gst_factory_klass`` is a thin, lazily-imported
shim over the real registry for production use.
