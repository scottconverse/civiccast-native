"""Atomic rolling WAV segments for the GStreamer live-caption audio fork.

Item 88 (measured in sandbox run 17, soak-a6d7871-20260906-213332Z, Opus
diagnosis): every worker reached PLAYING and pushed real TS output at
~3.2 Mbps for 26-100s, then output stopped and the 10s stall watchdog killed
the worker. Root cause: this writer used to do its blocking I/O (WAV close,
``flush``, ``os.fsync``, atomic ``replace``) directly on the appsink's
``new-sample`` callback -- which runs on the GStreamer STREAMING thread, the
same thread the caption-audio-tap ``queue`` element's default (non-leaky,
1s-deep) buffering can only absorb for so long. Once ``fsync``/rename took
long enough (two ffmpeg jobs + a Whisper ASR pass sharing the box), the
queue backed up, the tee it forks from stalled, and the mpegtsmux audio pad
that shares the same tee starved -- taking the CHANNEL off air over a
caption side-channel that was never supposed to be able to do that.

The fix: this module now only ever does fast, in-memory work
(``write_pcm_s16le`` appends PCM bytes to a plain ``bytearray`` under a
lock that guards ONLY that bookkeeping, never I/O) and hands a finished
segment's bytes to ``SegmentWriterThread``, a dedicated background thread
that owns all the blocking I/O. The hand-off itself
(``SegmentWriterThread.submit``) is non-blocking: a bounded queue that
drops the OLDEST pending segment (not the newest, and never by blocking)
when full -- the drop is COUNTED on the caller's thread (a plain lock
increment) but LOGGED only from the writer thread itself (see
``_maybe_log_drop``), at most once a minute, so no ``print`` (a real,
if usually fast, I/O call) ever runs on the streaming thread either.
A slow disk now degrades caption continuity -- a dropped few seconds of
caption audio -- instead of ever being able to stall the tee, and
therefore the mux, and therefore the channel.

Round-2 review BLOCKER: stopping this writer must itself be bounded. A
wedged disk (the exact failure this module exists to survive) can leave
``SegmentWriterThread`` stuck inside a single blocking ``_publish`` call
indefinitely -- Python cannot interrupt a thread out of a blocking syscall,
so ``stop()``/``close()`` cannot force that thread to exit. What they CAN
guarantee is that the CALLER is never blocked past a bound: ``stop()`` signals
a ``threading.Event`` (never an unbounded queue ``put`` -- a full queue would
otherwise make even the STOP signal block) and joins with a timeout. If the
thread is still alive after that bound, ``stop()``/``close()`` log a WARNING
and return ``"abandoned"`` rather than waiting further; the (daemon) thread is
left running in the background and may finish later or never. Callers that
need "did everything really land on disk" must check the return value --
``"drained"`` is the only value that promises that.

Companion fix on the GStreamer graph side (``engine.py``'s
``_build_audio_tap`` / ``_audio_tap_element_specs``): the
``caption_audio_tap_queue`` element is now ``leaky=2`` (downstream -- drop
the OLDEST buffered data rather than block upstream) with its ``max-size-time``
default disabled (see that module's own comment for why bytes/buffers stay at
GStreamer's stock defaults), and the appsink is ``drop=True``. Both layers
exist because they guard different failure points: the queue protects the tee
from a slow appsink callback; this module's own bounded queue protects the
appsink callback from a slow disk. Removing either layer re-opens a path for
the caption side-channel to take the channel off air.
