#: D45 fix (2026-09-05): D43 (#170) set this to 1800.0 to lengthen a
#: schedule-derived plan for the sake of the ROLLOVER cadence (see
#: ``automation._check_plan_rollover``'s D43 comments). Real-hardware soak
#: evidence (3 GStreamer channels, a schedule of 30-second items
#: back-to-back) then measured the actual cost of that: chasing 1800s of
#: planned duration out of 30-second slots builds ~60 segments per plan, and
#: ``bridge.graph_from_config`` builds ONE filesrc->decodebin->videoconvert->
#: videoscale->videorate sub-chain PER segment in a SINGLE pipeline that is
#: set to PLAYING all at once (``engine._build_playlist``) -- avdec_h264 at
#: its default max-threads=0 spins up ~20 threads per sub-chain, so 60
#: sub-chains produced ~1200 threads and ~3.5 GB on one worker, with no TS
#: buffer landing inside the 10s stall watchdog
#: (``engine.py``'s ``CTRL stall: no output for 10s``). Every worker
#: relaunched roughly every 30s. The pipeline SHAPE (segment count) has to
#: be bounded on its own terms -- CPU-only stations building 1200 decoder
#: threads is unsafe regardless of how "correct" the resulting wall-clock
#: window is -- so this is back to 0.0 (no duration floor at all;
#: ``max_segments`` alone decides how many sub-chains a plan gets). The
#: rollover-cadence problem D43 was actually solving is fixed at its own
#: layer instead: ``ChannelAutomationService._rollover_min_interval_seconds``
#: (automation.py) now derives its per-channel dispatch floor from the
#: ON-AIR plan's own duration rather than a fixed 300s, so a short plan still
#: gets rolled over comfortably inside its own lifetime.

#: U26 (2026-09-25): the size of schedule gap this provider will absorb.
#:
#: The gap this covers is a HOLE, not a short item: an instant that falls after
#: one item's window closed and before the next one's opened resolves to
#: nothing, and the rollover then fills it with filler -- the channel leaves its
#: program for a slate epoch, and the switch back runs through FALLBACK_SLATE's
#: immediate-reload path (daemon F3(b): worker exit, relay replacement).
#: Resolving the boundary straight to the item due within this window removes
#: the slate epoch entirely: the deferred switch is then program -> program,
#: in-worker, with no exit. Proven at this provider's boundary by probe
#: (reports/U26.md item 3): two items 0.5s apart resolve to None at 0.0 and to
#: the next item, 0.5s early, at 30.0.
#:
#: The two archived live incidents (government 02:13 / 02:58 MDT) measured a
#: related shortfall at a different layer, and this constant is not what
#: repairs them: the channel left its program with 11.0s of the CLOSING item's
#: own recorded plan end still to run (02:58:30.392844 - 02:58:19.385; ~9.6s at
#: 02:13), and the boundary provider answered
#: with that still-open item -- no filler plan and no ``target=filler`` rollover
#: appears in either log. What removed their second restart is the daemon-side
#: floor below (``daemon._SCHEDULE_TAIL_FLOOR_SECONDS``), which re-resolves 1s
#: past the closing item's plan end. See reports/U26.md items 1-2.
#:
#: ``30.0`` matches ``daemon._SCHEDULE_TAIL_FLOOR_SECONDS``, which refuses to
#: build a separate leg for a sub-30s remainder at all -- below that size a
#: slate epoch plus an exit/restart costs the station more than starting the
#: next item early by the gap. The two constants are complementary, not
#: duplicates: this one acts at plan BUILD time, before the channel ever leaves
#: its program, and only when the plan has nothing to air; the daemon floor
#: acts at RELOAD time for a plan resolved at the wall clock (slate replan,
#: operator reload), where only the daemon knows the channel is already on
#: slate and no live item can be cut short. A real gap (beyond this window)
#: keeps the old behavior: filler, then F3(b)'s restart detour for the cut.

    """Return the currently playable egress source plan, or None for slate fallback.

    The window is bounded by COUNT first (``max_segments``, 8 by default) --
    each segment becomes its own decoder sub-chain in the egress pipeline
    (``bridge.graph_from_config``), so the segment count IS the pipeline's
    shape, not just a wall-clock convenience. ``min_plan_seconds`` (D45: 0.0
    by default) is an OPTIONAL additional duration floor for a caller that
    explicitly wants a longer window and can bear a bigger pipeline; segments
    are appended until there are at least ``max_segments`` of them AND the
    plan spans at least ``min_plan_seconds``, whichever condition is
    satisfied later. ``segment_cap`` is the hard upper bound on the segment
    count regardless of either.

    Each segment is clipped to its SCHEDULE SLOT (D42): the slot is the
    contract, so long media in a 30-second slot plays for 30 seconds, not
    for its full asset length. When the media is SHORTER than its slot the
    plan stops at that item: the remainder of the slot belongs to the
    channel's fill policy (``bulletin_filler.FillerSourceProvider`` --
    bulletins or slate), reached through the daemon's FALLBACK_SLATE
    gap-replan path, exactly as an already-aired current item does below.
    Nothing here loops or stretches media to cover a slot, and no following
    item is ever started early -- the one exception is ``gap_absorb_seconds``
    below, which only applies when there is nothing at all to air.

    ``gap_absorb_seconds`` (U26, 2026-09-25; off by default) absorbs a small
    schedule gap. When the instant this plan is built for has NOTHING to air --
    it falls between two items, or the item covering it has already aired all
    of its media -- and the next item is due within this many seconds, the plan
    is built from that next item instead: the caller starts it at this instant,
    early by at most the gap. It exists because automation's own rollover
    resolves a boundary in such a gap to ``None``, rolls the channel onto
    filler, and must then take F3(b)'s exit-and-restart detour to get back to a
    program; absorbing the gap keeps the channel on its program and makes the
    switch an ordinary deferred in-worker reload. A gap LARGER than this window
    still returns None (filler is the honest answer there), and a plan that has
    anything to air is never replaced: a join-in-progress resume of a live item
    is content, not a stub, so it is never cut short to start the next item
    early. ``SCHEDULE_GAP_ABSORB_SECONDS`` is the value the station wires in.

    ``max_segment_seconds`` is an optional preparation horizon.  The
    GStreamer path uses it because that engine must pre-conform a source that
    cannot be trimmed in place; bounding the current segment lets a channel
    reach air quickly and lets the existing rollover machinery prepare the
    next join-in-progress slice while the current slice is playing.  It does
    not change the schedule's wall-clock position or the media trim window.

    ``media_duration_resolver`` (U36, 2026-09-25) measures the media FILE, and
    every segment is capped at what the file really has. Until this change the
    plan's durations came only from the database rows (``item.duration_seconds``
    -- the slot -- and ``asset.duration_seconds``/the trim window), so a row
    that overstated the media made the plan end past the file's real end. On
    the station's engine every plan is one leg (``max_segments=1``), so the
    leg's true EOS ended the pipeline: the worker exited 0 while ON_AIR and the
    relaunch re-resolved the same overstated clock into a sub-2-second sliver
    of a program that had already finished. With the media measured, such an
    item is recognised as exhausted like any other, so the U26 gap-absorb below
    hands the boundary to the next program (when it is due within the window)
    instead of re-airing a tail.

    Left ``None`` (the default) the builder keeps its row-only behaviour, which
    is what every direct caller wants: their fixtures are not real media, and a
    probe per plan build would make them non-deterministic. ``None`` from a
    resolver means the file could not be measured, and the rows stay
    authoritative -- fail-open, so a station without ffprobe is unaffected.
