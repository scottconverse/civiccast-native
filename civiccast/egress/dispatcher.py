"""PlayoutDispatcher — bridge a committed schedule item to the egress engine.

CivicCast 3.0 — S4 slice 3. When an operator commits an occurrence to air
(the Commit-to-Air gate), the committed schedule item is already present in
``schedule_items`` (scheduled, premiere). The egress engine is **pull-based**:
``ScheduleSourcePlanProvider`` / ``build_source_plan_from_schedule`` resolves
each channel's source plan dynamically from its scheduled items every cycle,
and re-resolves on a ``reload`` command. There is no persisted "active source
plan" table to write.

So the honest dispatch action — and what ``channel_automation`` itself already
does — is simply to **nudge the engine** with an existing :data:`EgressCommand`
action so it re-resolves promptly instead of waiting for its next natural
reload:

* if the channel is currently running (on air / starting / on slate /
  transitioning), enqueue ``reload`` so the daemon re-resolves and the
  committed program takes over when its window is current;
* if the channel is dark (no state / stopped / stopping / draining / error),
  enqueue ``start`` so a committed program brings the channel up.

This deliberately does **not** build or persist an ``EgressSourcePlan`` (the
spec text predates the pull-based engine; a plan built here would be an unused
artifact that could drift from what the resolver actually airs) and does
**not** add a new ``EgressCommand`` action — S5 owns ``takeover``/``handback``.
The proven resolver is the single source of truth for what airs.
