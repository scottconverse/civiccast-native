# relaunches, so the channel never reaches a stable on-air state — "dead air is
# NEVER acceptable" (see the encoder-unavailable comment below) was violated for
# exactly this case. At this many consecutive crash-relaunches that never once
# reached a healthy uptime (the streak only advances on a crash before the
# reset-uptime threshold; see _RESTART_STREAK_RESET_UPTIME_S), the daemon stops
# trusting the configured source and forces the same fallback-slate path used
# for EncoderUnavailableError/FfmpegNotFoundError in _start, instead of

# built with ``max_segments=1`` (automation.py:2634), so the plan for that slot
# is one segment covering only its remainder -- legal, prepared, and aired to
# EOS, after which the channel needs a SECOND worker start to reach the program
# that was due the whole time. The log pins the shape: the engine reached EOS at
# 02:58:19,385 for a plan whose own recorded end was 02:58:30.392844Z (~11s of
# slot left), the restart onto that stub went ON_AIR at 02:58:26,207, the stub
# itself ran to EOS at 02:58:34,137, and the next worker only reached ON_AIR at
# 02:58:36,574.

# Below this floor a tail is not worth the restart that installs it. Landing a
# restart costs ~10s end to end on this box (prepare ~2.2s + [terminate + exit
# detection] ~2.2s + respawn ~2.4s + worker start to first output ~2s + settle),
# so 30s is ~3x the cost of the switch itself -- while still an order of
# magnitude below the shortest plausible scheduled item, and half the
# automation's own 60s rollover lead margin so it can never fight the rollover

#
# The U16 finding (2026-09-24) was a one-sided rebase step -- one leg's
# timestamps moved ~109s and the other's did not -- and NOTHING in the egress
# path looked at the A/V relationship of the program actually leaving the
# encoder, so the only place that step was ever visible was a human watching the
# channel. This guard is the cheap output-side self-check that closes that gap:
# per channel, on a settled ON_AIR channel only, measure the first packet PTS of
# video and of audio in the newest COMPLETE segment of the channel's HLS window
# (``_segment_first_packet_pts``, U12's own ffprobe resolution/timeout/fail-safe)
# and, when the two stay apart across consecutive probes, restart that channel's
# worker the same way a dead encoder is restarted.
#
# The thresholds are deliberately loose. A SINGLE probe being off is normal --
# segment cuts land on video keyframes, so a cut segment's audio can legitimately
# lead or lag its video by a fraction of a frame, and a window roll can show one
# more of those -- which is why the verdict needs THREE consecutive over-limit
# probes (~90s of a channel that is visibly broken) and why the limit itself is
# a whole second rather than a frame. This guard is a backstop for a fault the

# BETA.10 U30: the relay-self-heal FAILURE escalation.
#
# The U30 finding (2026-09-25, observed live twice: education 06:27, government
# 01:03) is that the relay self-heal is a one-step recovery with no step after
# it. A deferred program->program reload commits at a segment boundary
# (``CTRL reload committed (elements=52)``), the HLS window stops advancing, the
# relay supervisor correctly detects the frozen window, correctly respawns its
# ffmpeg child once -- and that child then writes nothing either. The one-shot
# ``heal_attempted`` latch (hls_relay audit finding 4) deliberately prevents a
# second heal in the same episode, so the relay path is out of moves and the
# channel sits frozen until a human restarts it. Both live incidents ended
# exactly that way: ``STALE 36s -> 144s -> full channel restart``.
#
# This guard is the missing second step, modeled on the U16 output A/V guard
# above (same shape: probe on the existing poll tick, act through the existing
# bounded worker termination, bounded restarts per rolling hour, throttled
# CRITICAL once the budget is gone).
#
# SIGNAL DECISION: the HLS live window is the signal, and it is the only one.
# It is what residents actually see, the daemon already reads it every tick for
# the relay poll, and the relay supervisor already stamps an exact clock for it
# (``heal_frozen_seconds`` -- time since the heal). The worker's ``CTRL output: N
# buffers`` progress line is deliberately NOT used even though it is the more
# direct "is the engine producing" question: the daemon has no cheap, reliable
# seam to it. Those lines are written to the worker child's stderr and the

        # a worker crash whose relaunch (_poll_process -> _relaunch_after_
        # crash -> _begin_relaunch -> _start) runs BEFORE that same tick's
        # queued "reload" command is drained -- _start's pop ran first and
        # ate the value _request_reload's own pop needed moments later,
        # silently turning a should-cut-immediately rollover reload back into
        # a deferred one (a 900s held leg). _start must never pop this; only
        # _request_reload (every reader) and _stop (the channel going dark
        # makes any in-flight rollover moot) do.
        #
        # Round 5 (coordinator review): round 4's docstring here claimed the
        # entries left uncleared by _drain and stop_all_channels' "process
        # already gone" branch were benign because "every route back to a
        # seamless content reload for this channel goes through
        # _request_reload's own unconditional pop first, so a value sitting
        # here from before the channel went dark can never reach
        # should_defer_switch stale." That was FALSE: _request_reload's pop
        # does not discard the value, it PASSES it down (as
        # rollover_plan_end_at=) through _try_content_reload into
        # should_defer_switch -- popping a stale entry feeds it to
        # should_defer_switch exactly as readily as a fresh one would.
        # MEASURED: record_rollover_plan_end("gov", <2020-01-01>); let the
        # worker exit cleanly (rc=0, STOPPED) -- none of _stop, _drain, nor
        # stop_all_channels ran, so the value survived; restart the channel
        # (ON_AIR); issue a plain operator reload with no rollover behind it
        # at all -- switch_at_end_of_current came back False (cut
        # immediately) instead of True (should have deferred, the ordinary
        # ON_AIR/no-override shape). Every off-air route that bypasses
        # _stop -- _poll_process's clean-exit and terminal-ERROR worker-exit
        # branches, _drain's process-is-None branch, and stop_all_channels'
        # "already gone" branch -- now pops this itself, the same as _stop
        # does.
        #
        # Round 5 claimed this made it impossible for anything recorded
        # before a channel goes fully dark to survive to a later, unrelated
        # reload. That claim was ALSO false, MEASURED two more ways (round 6,
        # coordinator review):
        #
        # - Crash 1, then crash 2 landing inside the back-off cooldown, took
        #   the DEFERRED branch of _relaunch_after_crash: the channel sits in
        #   STARTING with no process running for the whole cooldown, and this
        #   value survived untouched (that branch never popped). When
        #   _service_backoff_relaunch later fired the deferred relaunch it
        #   re-resolved a fresh plan same as any other relaunch, so the stale
        #   value never fed that relaunch -- but it was still there to wrongly
        #   bind a DIFFERENT, later, plain operator reload landing during the
        #   cooldown. The same leak reached the same place when an operator
        #   explicit start command superseded the deferred relaunch instead
        #   (_process_command pops ``_backoff_relaunch`` there but was not
        #   popping this dict).
        # - _start's own two terminal-ERROR ``except`` clauses (ConfigInvalid/
        #   SecretUnresolved/FfmpegNotFound and the general EgressError
        #   fallback) never popped either. ERROR is not on air by any
        #   definition this dict cares about, so a value recorded going into
        #   a start attempt that lands in ERROR survived across it.
        #
        # Both routes now pop, closing those two gaps. Exactly two routes
        # deliberately still do NOT pop, and both are call sites of _start
        # that keep the channel effectively ON AIR through the transition
        # (per round 4's _start-must-never-pop fix above), relying on
        # _request_reload's own pop instead: the pending-reload restart
        # inside _poll_process, and the IMMEDIATE crash-relaunch path
        # (_relaunch_after_crash -> _begin_relaunch -> _start, taken when the
        # back-off latch permits running now rather than deferring).
        #
        # Round 7 (coordinator review): the IMMEDIATE crash-relaunch path
        # above still leaked, MEASURED: record_rollover_plan_end for a
        # rollover reload about to be enqueued -> a crash lands before that
        # command drains -> the immediate relaunch (_begin_relaunch -> _start,
        # which per round 4 must not pop) re-resolves a fresh plan and puts
        # the channel back ON_AIR -> the value sits here, popped by nothing,
        # until whatever "reload" command drains next -- which is not
        # necessarily the rollover's own command. A later, wholly unrelated
        # operator reload draining before (or instead of) the rollover's own
        # queued command inherited the stale, already-past plan_end_at and
        # was wrongly cut immediately (switch_at_end_of_current=False)
        # instead of deferring (True, the ordinary ON_AIR/no-override shape
        # an unrecorded reload takes). Every route above closes "does the
        # channel go off-air" leaks; none of them closes "does the reload
        # that drains next actually belong to the automation that recorded
        # this."
        #
        # Fixed by scoping the recorded value to the specific reload command
        # it was recorded for: this dict now stores ``(command_id,
        # plan_end_at)`` pairs. ``record_rollover_plan_end`` takes the
        # ``command_id`` of the reload command automation is about to
        # enqueue (see ``ChannelAutomationService._enqueue``, which now
        # returns the id it generated so the caller can record against the
        # exact same id).
        #
        # Round 8 (coordinator review): round 7's ``_request_reload`` popped
        # this dict UNCONDITIONALLY -- on every drain, matched or not -- and
        # only gated whether the popped value was USED on the id match. That
        # was still wrong, MEASURED: the common trigger is
        # ``ChannelAutomationService``'s own 45s issued-timeout retry
        # (``_check_plan_rollover``'s ``retrying_undelivered`` branch) --
        # dispatch A records ``command_id=A`` and enqueues reload A; the
        # daemon stalls past the retry timeout; the retry re-records
        # (OVERWRITING this dict's entry) ``command_id=B`` and enqueues
        # reload B. If A then drains first, round 7's unconditional pop threw
        # B's freshly-recorded entry away right there, on A's mismatch --
        # so when B itself drained moments later there was nothing left at
        # all, and ``should_defer_switch`` deferred against no recorded
        # horizon even though B's own horizon (the one just discarded) had
        # already passed. Round 6 measured the pre-scoping shape as
        # ``[False, True]`` (A wrongly cut); round 7's scoping flipped it to
        # ``[True, True]`` (both wrongly defer -- dead air on a horizon
        # already past, never cut at all).
        #
        # Fixed by popping ONLY when ``_request_reload``'s own ``command_id``
        # actually matches the recorded one -- a mismatch now LEAVES the
        # entry in place, untouched, for whichever command it was actually
        # recorded against to consume when THAT one drains, rather than
        # discarding it on the first unrelated command that happens to drain
        # first. This is safe against every off-air/relaunch leak inventoried
        # above: none of those routes go through ``_request_reload`` at all
        # -- each pops this dict itself, unconditionally, at its own off-air
        # transition (see every "Round N" entry above) -- so an entry left
        # here by a mismatch cannot outlive the channel going off-air either.
        # The one route this changes behavior for is exactly the one it
        # exists to fix: a later command matching the recorded id can still
        # find it and consume it, no matter how many *other* mismatched
        # reloads drained first.
        #
        # ``record_rollover_plan_end``'s ``command_id`` is now a required
        # keyword-only parameter -- the ``None`` "wildcard matches whatever
        # drains next" default is gone; a caller that does not (or cannot)
        # scope its recording must say so explicitly (``command_id=None``),
        # and an explicit ``None`` only matches a drain whose own
        # ``command_id`` is also ``None`` (the direct-call routes in

        "takeover", then a "stop" — sat unprocessed with zero log activity

        currently-pending batch consumed in one durable update before any of
        it runs (see ``EgressStore.pop_pending_commands``); an unguarded
        ``for`` loop here meant one command raising (e.g. the DEFECT A hls
        crash, or a hls-config'd channel's ``_start`` re-raising on every
        subsequent takeover/reload attempt because the broken sink was still
        configured) aborted the loop, and every command AFTER it in that same
        batch was already marked consumed — durably lost, never retried,
        with no per-command trace of what happened. Isolating each command's
        processing means one bad command can no longer take the rest of the
        batch down with it; the crashed command itself is still consumed
        (at-most-once delivery is unchanged — reissue it), but everything
        queued alongside or after it still runs.

        branch): ``_poll_process``/``_service_backoff_relaunch`` write
        persisted state on a crash-relaunch (``_write_state``,
        ``append_proof_event``), and ``_poll_hls_relay`` can too. Before this
        fix, an exception escaping ANY of the three (e.g. the exact
        ``UnicodeEncodeError`` the encoding fix closes, or any other write
        failure) propagated out of ``process_once`` and aborted the WHOLE
        pass for that channel — including ``pop_pending_commands`` below,
        so every queued command (takeover, stop, ...) sat unprocessed too,
        not just the poll that failed. Guarding each call the same way the
        command loop below already guards each command means one poll's
        write failure can never again take the rest of the pass down with
        it — the failing poll is simply retried next tick (each is
        idempotent against durable state), exactly like a failed command is
        simply reissued.

        Live defect (2026-09-24): after a supervisor restart, ``egress_states``
        kept reading ON_AIR for three channels whose encoder PIDs no longer
        existed, and the HLS playlists stayed frozen. The daemon's
        ``_processes`` map is in-memory, so a fresh instance tracks no encoder;
        recovery is normally driven by ``ChannelAutomationService`` re-issuing
        ``start`` for a channel with no live process -- but only for
        ``auto_start`` channels, so a persisted-ON_AIR channel that is NOT
        auto_start was never reconciled and its stale row was trusted forever.

        For each enabled channel whose persisted row claims an on-air state AND
        whose encoder is *definitively gone* (see ``_encoder_is_gone``), it
        atomically:

        * clears the stale claim by writing STOPPED, and
        * enqueues a ``start`` command issued by ``restart-recovery``,

        via ONE store transaction (``store.recover_stale_state(...)``) so there
        is no crash window in which STOPPED exists with no start queued -- the
        hazard that would otherwise strand the channel dark because STOPPED is
        not itself reconciled.

        This is the STARTUP arm, so it also clears a claim that carries NO pid
        at all: a crash before the pid was recorded leaves STARTING/ON_AIR with
        ``pid=None``, and a just-started daemon provably owns no encoder for any
        channel. The per-pass arm (:meth:`reconcile_dead_encoders`) deliberately
        does not, because on a running daemon that shape can be its own work.

        Safety properties:

        * a LIVE pid is never touched, and neither is a pid whose identity
          cannot be read -- fail closed, leave the row;
        * a channel this daemon tracks is never touched, even if its worker has
          already exited (``_poll_process`` owns that transition);
        * STOPPED / FALLBACK_SLATE / DRAINING rows are never touched;
        * the recovery command id is UNIQUE per attempt (and <=120 chars), so a
          LATER restart queues a fresh start (a constant id would be skipped
          forever by the SQL store's duplicate-id guard);
        * idempotent within one attempt: after recovery the row is STOPPED, so
          a re-run reports nothing and queues nothing.

                # program's conform does not need a free daemon thread, and the
                # conform that follows blocks only this thread while the slate is
                # already on air). What it collides with there is a different,
                # deliberately pinned contract: the crash-loop escalation ladder
                # below. Airing the slate on the first crash-relaunch writes
                # FALLBACK_SLATE immediately and stops the program being retried,
                # which is 22 pinned tests -- `_LIVE_SOURCE_FAILURE_FALLBACK_STREAK`
                # (a source that never comes up is retried until streak >= 5 and
                # reaches the slate at a measured 405.0 s,
                # test_daemon_first_output_timeout_relaunch.py) and the never-

                # This unit therefore implements the rule where the finding was
                # measured and where the station runs (the executor path), keeps

        having not exited yet.

        Checked (and, once True, latched into ``_on_air_confirmed_at``) on
        EVERY alive poll tick regardless of the channel's current state
        (ON_AIR / FALLBACK_SLATE / etc. all run a real encoder child that can
        supply this evidence) -- deliberately not gated the way
        ``_health_metrics`` is, since a channel airing the fallback slate
        through the SAME GStreamer engine is just as capable of proving it
        reached PLAYING.

        Round-4 (PR #183 review, BLOCKER reproduced): round-3's version read
        both evidence sources from the CHANNEL's log with no anchor to the
        CURRENT worker's own spawn point. ``strategy.py`` / ``_ffmpeg.py``
        both open this fixed per-channel log in APPEND mode and never
        truncate it per spawn, so one worker EVER reaching PLAYING (or ever
        showing FFmpeg progress) left that evidence sitting in the log
        forever -- every later worker on the same channel read as "confirmed
        on air" on its very first poll tick, even one that never produced
        any output itself (measured: 40 relaunches, streak pinned at 1; the
        round-3 healthy-uptime clock never actually started from THIS
        worker's evidence, because it kept reading a PREVIOUS worker's).
        Both evidence sources below are now anchored to
        ``self._stderr_spawn_offset[channel_id]`` -- the byte size of the log
        at the moment THIS worker was spawned (see that attribute's
        docstring) -- so a previous worker's evidence, which always sits
        before that offset, is never read at all, not merely filtered out
        after the fact.

        Two encoder families, two evidence sources, either is sufficient:

        * GStreamer (``civiccast.egress.gst.engine.GstPlayoutEngine``): the
          ``CTRL first-output: ...`` stderr marker
          ``_maybe_print_first_output_marker`` prints ONLY once a real TS
          buffer has crossed the mux (see
          ``civiccast.egress.health.worker_produced_output``).

          Item 84 Round-2 review BLOCKER, CORRECTING this function's own
          prior text directly above (which cited the ``CTRL preroll:
          reached PLAYING`` marker / ``worker_reached_playing`` as
          sufficient evidence here): PLAYING (even ``NO_PREROLL``) is NOT
          evidence a single buffer ever crossed the mux. The reviewer
          measured the exact consequence of treating it as such -- a worker
          that reaches PLAYING on every single relaunch but never produces
          real output (at ANY ``first_output_timeout_s`` from 65s through
          the 120s clamp ceiling) got its crash-loop streak reset by THIS
          alive-poll path on every cycle, and never escalated to fallback
          slate (streak pinned at 1) no matter how long the budget ran.
          ``worker_reached_playing``/the PLAYING marker are UNCHANGED and
          still printed (useful for operator logs and for
          ``EgressDaemon._poll_process``'s own on-air-evidence-latch
          docstring elsewhere), but this evidence gate now requires the
          LATER, stronger ``worker_produced_output`` instead -- same
          spawn-offset anchor and pid check as ``worker_reached_playing``
          (see that function's own docstring for the full round-4
          append-log rationale, which applies unchanged here), so even a
          marker that somehow lands at or after the offset cannot be
          credited to the wrong worker.
        * FFmpeg (the other encoder strategy this daemon can launch): no
          output marker exists, but ``read_ffmpeg_encoder_metrics_since``
          parses live fps=/bitrate= progress out of the same stderr log,
          anchored the same way -- reused here via ``encoder_has_progress``
          as the FFmpeg-side equivalent: real encoding progress is at least
          as strong a signal as a GStreamer worker's first output buffer,
          and without this branch an FFmpeg-encoded channel would NEVER get
          its healthy-uptime reset at all (the GStreamer markers only ever
          appear in a GStreamer worker's log).

        The gate order here is the contract, and each clause exists because
        violating it would restart something that is not broken:

        * No live worker -> nothing to measure and nothing to restart.
        * Worker pid changed -> the previous worker's measurements are void
          (streak reset), but the probe CADENCE is left alone: a relaunch must
          not make the guard probe faster than once per interval.
        * Not ON_AIR/FALLBACK_SLATE -> not judged. STARTING has no output yet,
          DRAINING is deliberately leaving air, and TRANSITIONING is what
          ``_poll_process`` publishes for a channel with a content reload in
          flight -- exactly the moment the U16 rebase step happens, and a
          legitimate reason for A/V to move against each other for a moment.
          This guard judges the settled output, never the switch.
        * FALLBACK_SLATE IS judged (U21 item B2). The slate leg runs through the
          same mux, the same udpsink and the same relay child as a program leg,
          so it can carry - and strand - the same output A/V offset; the U21
          slate-entry incident was measured on a slate leg. Excluding it left
          the desync shape with no net at all, because B1's rebind cannot cure
          an offset born on a slate the worker never restarts out of. Judging a
          slate leg is safe for the same reason judging a program leg is: the
          guard reads the worker's own settled output, and a slate leg that
          cannot settle is exactly what a restart repairs.
        * Inside the probe interval -> not yet time (the tick rate is 2s).
        * Probe could not measure -> neither advances nor resets the streak, and
          can never restart anything by itself.

        The guard does NOT poll the worker itself. It runs LAST in the poll
        tuple, so ``_poll_process`` has already processed any exit this tick --
        it either published the state row for a live worker or moved the channel
        on (relaunch, slate, stop). A poll here would be a second, unordered
        reader of the same process's exit state: it changes when the exit is
        first observed by everything downstream of it, which is a real coupling
        (it silently shifted a reload-settlement tick's liveness re-check in
        ``test_worker_exit_between_poll_process_and_poll_reload_settlement_falls_back``)
        for no gain -- the state row this guard gates on is already the answer.

        """U30: escalate when a relay self-heal has run and the window is STILL frozen.

        The relay supervisor's self-heal is one-shot per stall episode by design
        (hls_relay audit finding 4: a second heal in the same episode would be a
        restart storm), so a heal that does not restore the window leaves that
        path with no next move. This poll is the next move: it waits
        ``_FREEZE_ESCALATION_AFTER_HEAL_S`` past the heal and, if the window is
        still frozen, restarts the channel's worker through the ordinary
        crashed-encoder relaunch path.

        The gate order is the contract, and each clause exists so that nothing
        healthy is ever restarted:

        * No live worker entry -> nothing to restart, and the channel's
          bookkeeping is dropped (a stopped channel must not carry a stale
          budget into its next start).
        * Not ON_AIR/FALLBACK_SLATE, or draining -> not judged. These are the
          only two states in which the channel is supposed to be delivering a
          settled program. STARTING and TRANSITIONING are explicitly exempt:
          both are transient by construction (TRANSITIONING is what
          ``_poll_process`` publishes while a content reload is in flight --
          exactly when the U30 freeze has been seen) and neither has a window
          that is supposed to be advancing yet. DRAINING is leaving air on
          purpose.
        * Worker pid changed -> the episode is voided. A replacement worker's
          frozen predecessor-window is not evidence about it.
        * Already escalated for THIS pid -> nothing more to do (the killed
          worker is still the live entry until its exit is reaped).
        * ``heal_frozen_seconds`` is under the bound -> not a failed heal yet,
          or no relay in a failed-heal state at all. ``None`` (no relay
          tracked, or no live relay is mid-failed-heal) means "this question
          does not apply" and must never escalate: with no relay in play there
          is no heal to have failed.

        The signal is the HLS live window and only that -- see the constants
        block at the top of this module for why the worker's own output-progress
        line is deliberately not used.

        The restart is the SAME route the output A/V guard and a dead encoder
        take: terminate the worker WITHOUT recording it in ``_reload_kills``, so
        its exit is an ordinary non-zero exit that ``_poll_process`` next tick
        finds, with the row still ON_AIR, and hands to ``_relaunch_after_crash``
        -- the ordinary crash-relaunch path with its own back-off and
        accounting. The kill is bounded, so the worker is genuinely gone by the
        next tick rather than only asked to leave.

        This method does NOT touch the relay child, and that is the whole point of
        the split: the self-heal this escalation exists to escalate ALREADY
        replaced that child (its age is what ``heal_frozen_seconds`` reports), and
        in both live incidents the fresh child wrote nothing either -- a child
        that stops writing while its upstream has stopped feeding it is evidence
        about the upstream, not about the child, so replacing it a second time
        buys nothing. Nothing has replaced the WORKER, so the WORKER is what this
        restarts.

        Do NOT read that as "the relaunch leaves the relay alone end to end".
        On the merged beta10 line it does not: the relaunch reaches
        ``HlsRelaySupervisor.apply`` with the worker dead, so it takes U21's
        ``new_session=True`` path, which drops the channel's ``_Relay`` record
        and spawns a FRESH child -- a fresh one-shot ``heal_attempted`` latch
        (hls_relay audit finding 4) on the same deterministic port, so the
        still-frozen playlist re-arms exactly one further heal per relay
        incarnation. That is bounded, but the bound is the rolling-hour
        ``_FREEZE_ESCALATION_RESTART_BUDGET`` below (and the throttled CRITICAL
        once it is spent), NOT the heal latch. The merged-line sequence is pinned

        ``test_hls_relay_progress.py::test_daemon_tick_sequence_with_escalation_is_bounded_not_a_storm``;
        the latch by itself is pinned by that file's

        switched off.

        reload): relaunch onto the program that is now due instead of going
        dark. Returns ``(relaunched, stop_error)``: ``(True, None)`` when the
        relaunch was taken (``_start`` was invoked, or the relaunch was
        handed to the crash back-off path -- either way the caller returns
        and that path owns every state write from here), otherwise
        ``(False, reason)`` where ``reason`` is ``None`` for the ordinary
        STOPPED outcome (the channel was not on slate, no program is due, or
        an operator stop/drain is already queued) and a human-readable
        ``last_error`` when the consecutive-relaunch cap refused another one.

        See ``_SLATE_EOS_RELAUNCH_MAX_CONSECUTIVE`` for the walkthrough that
        found this. The automation's slate replan normally reloads BEFORE the
        slate ends; this is the belt for the case where that reload's own
        synchronous prepare (a cold conform) outlasts the slate's horizon and
        the worker exits underneath it.

        Round-2 hostile review, items 1-3, in order below:

        * a queued operator ``stop``/``drain`` wins (``process_once`` polls
          BEFORE it drains commands, so without this peek the relaunch spawned
          a worker the Stop then had to kill, and the Stop waited behind a
          cold prepare);
        * the consecutive cap is a COUNT, not a time window (the slate plan
          runs up to 120s, so a 30s window never fired);
        * the relaunch honours the crash back-off exactly like
          ``_relaunch_after_crash``: a streak at or past
          ``_LIVE_SOURCE_FAILURE_FALLBACK_STREAK`` renews the slate
          (``force_fallback_slate``) instead of retrying the dead source, and
          a still-cooling ``_restart_latch`` defers through
          ``_backoff_relaunch`` instead of bypassing it. A slate RENEWAL does
          not count toward the cap: it is the B1 terminal state that replaces
          dead air, and ``ChannelAutomationService._check_slate_replan``
          retries the real source on its own cooldown.

        separate bound -- see ``_SLOW_START_EXIT_CODES``) -- neither a crash --
        still relaunches through the exact same path below -- the existing
        back-off/cooldown pacing applies unchanged -- but does NOT advance the
        crash-loop streak more than once per ``_PREROLL_TIMEOUT_STREAK_COOLDOWN_S``

        Round-2 review BLOCKER (Opus, PR #183): a preroll-timeout exit's
        ``uptime`` (how long the worker was alive before it gave up) is NOT
        evidence of a healthy run -- it is simply how long the doomed preroll
        attempt took, which can legitimately be close to (engine.py now clamps

        below. Applying that reset to a preroll-timeout exit would silently
        defeat the crash-loop escalation to fallback slate for a source that
        NEVER comes up (measured: 40 consecutive relaunches, streak stuck at
        0, before this exemption existed) -- so this reset is skipped
        entirely for that exit reason; only a genuinely different exit

        3). See ``_rollover_plan_end_at``'s docstring for why this rides an
        in-memory side channel rather than the durable command queue.

        Round 7 (coordinator review): ``command_id`` should be the id of the
        SAME reload command the caller is about to enqueue (``_enqueue``
        returns the id it generated for exactly this purpose) -- it scopes
        the recorded value so ``_request_reload`` only hands it to
        ``should_defer_switch`` when the command actually draining is this
        one, never a different reload that happens to land first.

        Round 8 (coordinator review): ``command_id`` is now a REQUIRED
        keyword-only argument -- the round-7 ``None`` default doubled as a
        "wildcard, matches whatever drains next" behavior that zero
        production callers actually relied on (``ChannelAutomationService``
        is the only recorder, in `automation.py`, and it always supplies a
        real generated id). Removing the default forces every caller to say
        explicitly whether it is scoping a real id or deliberately recording
        unscoped (``command_id=None``) -- and ``None`` is no longer special:
        it matches a drain whose own ``command_id`` is also ``None`` by
        ordinary equality (see ``_request_reload``'s docstring), not by a
        wildcard carve-out.

        a DEFERRED switch: a deferred rollover's plan is built at dispatch but
        takes air at the outgoing item's own end, so a horizon measured from
        dispatch is partly spent by the time the plan is on air (live
        2026-09-25 education: 689 s planned at 23:41:56, 83 s left at the
        23:53:17 switch, EOS at 23:54:41). With the horizon measured from the

        U26 defect 2, generalized by U36 decision 2. A plan that resolves the
        item due at some instant I -- wall-clock now (automation's slate gap
        replan in automation.py's ``_check_slate_replan``, an operator reload,
        the F3(b) reused-plan restart), a recorded rollover horizon, or a crash
        relaunch -- can land on an item whose slot is nearly over. The resolver
        then hands back a legal but degenerate plan (see
        ``_SCHEDULE_TAIL_FLOOR_SECONDS``) that the channel airs to its end and
        then EOSes on, costing a whole second restart to reach the program that
        was due all along. U36's incident is the same defect on the two paths
        the U26 guard skipped: the 14:06:50 horizon-bound rollover (whose new
        leg delivered 1.6s before EOS -- ``mux-in 1.6s: video=+24 audio=+37``
        -- on a horizon the plan recorded 3.65s past the outgoing leg's real
        end) and the 14:17:52 crash relaunch (a single sub-floor segment).

        So resolve the schedule where that tail ENDS instead -- the next item --
        and use it when it is a strict improvement. Everything else keeps the
        tail plan untouched, because in every one of those cases airing the tail
        is the honest behavior: a media-shorter-than-slot tail, a gap the fill
        policy owns, the end of the schedule, or a boundary that fails to
        prepare all resolve to ``None`` or to the same/short plan.

        It cannot skip a program that genuinely has more than the floor left:
        the body returns ``source_plan`` unchanged (identity, not a copy) before
        any boundary call whenever the tail is at or above
        ``_SCHEDULE_TAIL_FLOOR_SECONDS``, and even below the floor the
        replacement is only taken when the plan due where the tail ends is
        STRICTLY longer than the tail it replaces. A tail of 30s or more is
        therefore never even measured against the schedule, and a shorter one is
        only ever exchanged for more media than it had.

        ``resolved_at`` is the instant the plan was resolved for. Callers that
        resolved at a known instant (a recorded rollover horizon) pass it, so
        the second look lands where THAT tail ends rather than where
        wall-clock now happens to be; callers that resolved at wall-clock now
        pass nothing.

        ``slate_when_no_next`` (U36 decision 2: "the leg starts the NEXT program
        instead (slate only if there is no next program)") arms the fallback
        slate for the two paths where a sub-floor tail is otherwise aired to an
        EOS that takes the worker down -- the horizon-bound rollover and the
        crash relaunch. The U26 no-horizon call site leaves it False and keeps
        its documented contract: ``None`` is never returned there, because a
        declined plan would send the caller to ``_request_reload``'s
        terminate+restart fallback, which is what the tail plan is already
        about to get anyway.

        to each per-plan file (``preparer.py``'s ``-t segment.duration_seconds`` on
        the bounded conform and on the GStreamer engine's cache-hit copy-out), and
        the bridge builds one decoder sub-chain per segment that runs to that file's

        makes the hand-off land on the programme's scheduled start.

        Measured on this station (U53 Part I): the 17:57-18:07 education rollover

        Resolves the newly-due plan (same provider → preparer chain as ``_start``) and
        tells the running worker to rebuild its program leg in place. Returns False —
        so the caller falls back to terminate+restart — for any case the seamless path
        can't own: no/disabled config, no/foreign/invalid plan, a prepare failure, a
        strategy error, or a worker control channel that isn't ready yet.

        F1 redesign (coordinator hostile review, 2026-09-06): ``reload_content``
        returning True means the worker ACCEPTED the request for arm/preroll,
        NOT that it has committed -- committing (or
        aborting) can take up to the worker's own ``defer_switch_timeout_s`` (900s
        default) for a deferred/boundary-aligned switch (the automation-driven
        ON_AIR-extension case this method exists for -- see
        ``reload_policy.should_defer_switch``). Doing the ON_AIR proof-event/state
        bookkeeping immediately, as the pre-redesign code did, would therefore
        claim the channel is airing the NEW source before the switch has actually
        happened -- for a deferred switch, the OLD content is often still
        genuinely on air for minutes after this method returns.

        This method now only ARMS the reload and records a
        ``_PendingReloadSettlement`` in ``self._pending_reload_settle``; the
        state/proof-event bookkeeping is deferred to ``_commit_reload_settlement``,
        invoked by ``_poll_reload_settlement`` once ``reload-status.json`` actually
        reports ``"applied"`` (or the daemon falls back to restart on
        ``"aborted:<reason>"``/a deadline lapse). Returns True as soon as the
        reload is armed -- this is what tells the CALLER (``_request_reload``) not
        to fall back to terminate+restart; it does not mean the switch landed.

        Item 78 fix 3 (coordinator review, round 3): ``rollover_plan_end_at``
        is a required keyword-only parameter, not read from
        ``self._rollover_plan_end_at`` inside this method -- the CALLER
        (``_request_reload``) pops the dict and passes the value down
        explicitly. Round 2 popped it at the top of THIS method, which fixed
        the leak for every early return inside this method's own body, but
        ``_request_reload`` itself has three earlier exits that never call
        this method at all (the worker is missing/dead -> ``_start``; no
        state row; the strategy doesn't declare ``supports_content_reload``)
        -- each of those left the recorded value sitting in
        ``self._rollover_plan_end_at`` forever, to be read by whatever
        reload attempt for this channel came next. Popping in the one
        caller that is reached on every single "reload" command, before any
        of ITS branches run, is what actually closes all of them.

        U41: ``rollover_plan_min_seconds`` is the horizon the dispatcher
        measured for this rollover, threaded down from the same record as
        ``rollover_plan_end_at`` and applied to the boundary plan of a DEFERRED
        switch only (see the eligibility gate where the provider is called).
        It is the difference between a plan that has a full lead of life when
        it takes air and one that has already spent its lead waiting -- the

        pre-commit, instead of discarding it and leaving the boundary unprepared.

        Returns True when this method has already decided what happens next --
        either a retry is armed, or (retries exhausted) the fallback slate is
        armed AT the boundary. The caller must then do nothing further; the
        terminate+restart fallback it would otherwise run never happens, which is
        the point: the outgoing leg keeps airing while the retry is armed.
        False means "not an aborted BOUNDARY reload" -- carry on with the
        pre-U36 behavior (log, discard, restart fallback).

        Only a rollover-armed reload gets this treatment: the retry re-resolves
        through ``_request_reload``/``_reload_steps`` with the SAME horizon, so
        it goes through the U36 tail floor again (decision 2(i)). A reload with
        no horizon has no boundary to protect and no measured failure mode, so
        it keeps the plain restart fallback.

        Bounded by ``_RELOAD_RETRY_LIMIT``; the budget is keyed by horizon, so a
        NEW boundary starts at zero without anything having to clear the entry
        (see ``_reload_retries``). Once the slate arm itself has been tried and
        aborted too (``used > _RELOAD_RETRY_LIMIT``), this returns False and the
        channel takes the ordinary restart fallback rather than re-arming the
        slate forever.

        Evidence: on 2026-09-25 the public channel's 14:44 boundary reload was
        ``aborted:error``, discarded with no retry (``_fall_back_to_restart_
        reload`` does not terminate an ON_AIR worker, so nothing even restarted),
        and the next boundary then arrived with nothing prepared -- 10s aggregate

        boundary, and a pin whose only exit route is gone is permanent.

        branch does, so ``_poll_process``'s crash-relaunch re-resolves and
