"""Select the egress encoder strategy (the GStreamer engine vs. ffmpeg-concat).

A deployment-level choice, via the ``CIVICCAST_EGRESS_ENGINE`` environment
variable (matching the project's other ``CIVICCAST_*`` flags). Default is the
GStreamer engine (S15) -- it alone fixes continuity bug #151 (the persistent
pipeline never restarts the mux on plan/reload boundaries) and is the engine
the native station bootstrap ships. Existing deployments that still need the
legacy ffmpeg concat path can opt back in with
``CIVICCAST_EGRESS_ENGINE=ffmpeg-concat``; that path -- and the
GStreamer -> FFmpeg -> slate degraded-mode fallback chain
(``civiccast.native.station_runtime`` / ``civiccast.egress.daemon``) -- is
unchanged by this default flip.
