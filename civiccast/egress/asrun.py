"""As-run capture seam for the egress engine (S23 §6.1).

The playout engine emits an ``EgressProofEvent`` at every ACTUAL source
transition (after the encoder is live — the on-air instant, not scheduled
intent). S23 proof-of-performance needs a permanent, append-only record of what
ACTUALLY aired, distinct from what was scheduled, so the engine writes an
as-run entry at each transition.

This module defines the *engine-side seam* only:

* ``AsRunRecorder`` — the protocol the daemon calls (``record_transition`` at
  each ON_AIR/FALLBACK_SLATE proof-event site; ``close_open`` at terminal
  states). The concrete, store-backed implementation lives in
  ``civiccast.reporting`` so the engine never imports the reporting package
  (keeps the hot playout path import-clean and dependency-free).
* ``map_source_kind`` — maps the engine's source taxonomy
  (``EgressSourceKind`` = ``program``/``slate``/``live``/``cg``, plus the
  ``FALLBACK_SLATE`` running state) to the as-run ``source_kind``
  (``program``/``filler``/``live``/``slate``/``spot``). ``cg`` filler bulletins
  map to ``filler``; a forced/fallback slate maps to ``slate``.
* ``asset_id_for_segment`` — the asset id to record, guarded on kind: only a
  ``program`` segment carries a real library ``asset_id`` in ``source_ref``
  (slate is ``civiccast-slate``, filler is ``bulletin-<id>`` — neither is a
  library asset).

The recorder is **append-only and fail-safe**: a capture error must never break
playout (the daemon wraps every call in a ``try/except`` that only logs, exactly
like the existing proof-event / reap auditing seams).
