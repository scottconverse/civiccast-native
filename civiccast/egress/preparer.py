"""Source preparation for canonical egress playout assets.

#156 (long-asset TRANSITIONING stall): preparation used to re-conform the
same asset from scratch at every airing, synchronously, at airtime — a long
recording could hold the channel in TRANSITIONING for minutes at top-of-hour.
Preparation now keeps a **persistent conform cache** under
``work_dir/conform-cache``:

* the cacheable unit is the **full-asset conform** (keyed by source file
  fingerprint + canonical profile + loudness config). Trim/join-in-progress
  offsets are applied at *playout* instead — the emitted segment carries
  ``inpoint``/``outpoint`` and the encoder's ffconcat plan already honors them
  (:func:`civiccast.egress.runtime.write_concat_plan`);
* a cache **hit** costs zero ffmpeg work and zero loudness probing: a program
  whose asset has aired before starts within seconds (the #156 acceptance bar);
* a trimmed cache **miss** (typically a first-ever join-in-progress start)
  conforms only the remaining portion straight to air — identical latency to
  the old behavior — and *warm-behind* conforms the full asset into the cache
  on a background thread so the next airing hits. First-ever airing latency is
  therefore unchanged and documented in the runbook rather than hidden;
* the cache is bounded (``CIVICCAST_CONFORM_CACHE_GB``, default 60; ``<= 0``
  disables caching entirely) with oldest-first eviction, hits refreshing the
  entry's clock.

#: can never finish inside it, so the warm was killed, the failure was logged
#: and the next airing re-queued it -- the same asset burned CPU forever and
#: never populated the cache. Measured on the live station (2026-09-25, three
#: station encoders running) a 9020.8s asset conforms at 16.3x realtime on one
#: thread at below-normal priority, i.e. 555s alone and 866s under contention;
#: the flat 300s bound was below even the uncontended cost. The warm bound now
#: scales with the asset, from a de-rated design speed rather than the best
#: measurement, and keeps the flat bound as a floor for short assets -- see
#: ``warm_preparation_timeout_seconds``. The on-demand/air-path timeout is
#: deliberately NOT rescaled: a segment's airing must still fail closed fast.
#:
#: 8.0x is the design speed: the measured 16.3x alone and 10.4x against a
#: concurrent foreground conform are both faster, so this is a worst case that
#: still terminates rather than a target.
_WARM_CONFORM_DESIGN_SPEED_RPS = 8.0
#: Headroom over the design-speed estimate. The warm has no interactive
#: deadline -- its only cost of over-running is a longer-lived child -- so the
#: bound is set to tolerate a machine materially slower than the one the design
#: speed was measured on.
_WARM_CONFORM_TIMEOUT_FACTOR = 1.5
#: Ceiling on the scaled bound. There is ONE warm worker thread, so a bound
#: that scales without limit would let a single pathological asset (or a
#: misreported duration) hold the warm queue for the rest of the day. This is a
#: cap on WALL CLOCK, not on asset duration: at the measured 16.3x, 2h still

_WARM_CONFORM_TIMEOUT_CEILING_SECONDS = 7200.0

#: burn was continuous. Six hours suppresses roughly twelve consecutive airings
#: -- long enough that a permanently unwarmable asset costs a handful of
#: whole-asset attempts a day instead of one per airing, short enough that a
#: transient cause (disk pressure, a saturated box) gets another attempt the
#: same working day with no operator action.
_WARM_FAILURE_BACKOFF_SECONDS = 6 * 60 * 60.0

#: F3 fix (hostile-review follow-up, 2026-09-06): the age-only GC this replaced
#: had no size/count budget at all, so a channel doing frequent rollovers (the

#: per-plan directories over a 6-hour window. GC is now keep-N-most-recent
#: FIRST (a directory this recent could plausibly still be the one a live
#: worker is reading, or one the daemon hasn't yet released -- see
#: ``release``), THEN a byte budget across whatever is left, and only falls
#: back to a bare age floor as an absolute last resort for anything neither

#: the ride's ``{key}.ts.tmp.ride-audio.ts`` muxed intermediate and its
#: ``civiccast-ride-*.pcm`` PCM tee (``civiccast.egress.loudness_ride``).
#: BETA.10 U53: classifying by name instead of by a ``*.ts`` glob is what
#: keeps the ride's two artifacts out of the ENTRY set -- ``.ride-audio.ts``

#: (-70 LUFS at the head of a 39-minute meeting recording), which would
#: then drive loudnorm's normalization target completely wrong and get
#: memoized for every other segment/airing of that asset. The sample
#: window now starts partway into the asset instead of at the very head.
_UNTRIMMED_LOUDNESS_PROBE_FRACTION = 0.4

#: Item 66 round-5 (Opus review, point 3): the offset for the SECOND
#: bounded sample, taken only when the first (40%-in) sample measures at

#: extended silence would otherwise look like agreement).
_UNTRIMMED_LOUDNESS_PROBE_FRACTION_2 = 0.7

#: A measurement at or below this integrated LUFS is indistinguishable from
#: silence/room tone for any of CivicCast's target loudness standards (the

#: program loudness.
_LOUDNESS_SILENCE_FLOOR_LUFS = -60.0

#: Item 66 round-7 (Opus review, point 2, MEDIUM fix): a single HEAD sample
#: is only genuinely conclusive proof of silence when its own window
#: (``min(duration, _UNTRIMMED_LOUDNESS_PROBE_CAP_S)`` from the very start)
#: covers the WHOLE asset -- i.e. ``duration <= _UNTRIMMED_LOUDNESS_PROBE_CAP_S``
#: itself. Round-6 set this to ``_UNTRIMMED_LOUDNESS_PROBE_CAP_S * 2`` (240s)
#: instead, reasoning only about when a genuinely independent SECOND sample
#: could fit -- but that let a 120-240s asset's single 120s HEAD sample (at
#: most half the file) get trusted as "the whole (or nearly the whole)
#: asset" when it was really only up to half of it: a real field failure
#: (a 200s clip with audio starting at 130s, entirely past the sampled
#: window, memoized as -70 LUFS silence). Below/at this duration the one
#: sample truly is (nearly) the whole file, so it needs no corroboration;
#: above it, the "long asset" branch below is used instead -- its first
#: sample already sits at 40% in (never the head) and, on a floor reading,
#: corroborates with a second bounded sample before trusting silence, which
#: is what protects the 120-240s range now.
_SHORT_ASSET_SINGLE_SAMPLE_MAX_S = _UNTRIMMED_LOUDNESS_PROBE_CAP_S

#: Item 66 round-7 (point 1, HIGH): D42 (source_plan.py's ``_segment_duration``,
#: ``min(slot, playable)``) means an "untrimmed" segment (no inpoint/outpoint)
#: can carry a ``duration_seconds`` SHORTER than the asset's real media length
#: whenever the schedule slot is shorter than the asset -- a 30s slot on a
#: 67s asset produces a 30s bounded conform that is NOT the whole asset,
#: even though ``trimmed`` (inpoint/outpoint both None) is False. The same
#: tolerance ``source_plan.py``'s own ``_covers_slot`` uses for its slot/media
#: fuzz (1s) is reused here so a 29.97s asset in a 30s slot still counts as
#: "the whole asset" and gets promoted into the shared cache.

        later segments of the same asset can skip re-probing) -- so this
        must create the cache directory itself rather than assume a conform
        call already did.

        Item 66 round-3 (Opus review): tmp+replace atomic write, same
        discipline as every ``.ts`` write in this module -- a reader
        (``_read_cache_meta``, or the cache-HIT check's ``.is_file()``) must
        never observe a partially-written ``{key}.json``.

        ``media_duration_seconds`` (item 66 round-5, point 2; simplified
        round-6, point 3): the asset's real media duration, probed once via
        ``probe_media_duration_seconds`` and cached here so later
        segments/airings of the same asset never re-probe it. Every call
        site that could plausibly know this value now threads it through
        explicitly (``_conform_full_asset_into_cache``,
        ``_promote_conform_into_cache``, ``_promote_finished_conform_into_
        cache``, ``_schedule_cache_copy_promotion``, ``_schedule_warm`` all
        gained the same keyword) -- a round-5 version of this method instead
        read the existing meta back and merged in whatever value it already
        held, purely to avoid a later write-without-the-value clobbering an
        earlier write-with-it. That extra read on every write is no longer
        needed now that the value travels with the call: this write is the
        single atomic write of everything this cache entry's meta holds.

        ``full_asset_conform`` (item 66 round-7, point 1, HIGH): True ONLY
        when this write accompanies (or follows) an actual ``{key}.ts`` that
        genuinely holds the whole asset -- set exclusively by
        ``_promote_conform_into_cache``, the single choke point every
        promotion path (``_conform_full_asset_into_cache``,
        ``_promote_finished_conform_into_cache``, ``_schedule_cache_copy_
        promotion``'s job) funnels through right after the ``.ts`` itself is
        finalized. The probe-only call in ``_prepare_segment`` (persisted
        before any conform exists) never sets it, so it defaults False there.
        The cache-HIT check in ``_prepare_segment`` requires this flag before
        trusting ``{key}.ts`` as the shared full-asset entry -- see that
        check's own comment for why a numeric ``duration_seconds`` comparison
        alone cannot detect an already-on-disk short/truncated ``.ts`` (D42,
        round-6 BLOCKER: a slot-capped "untrimmed" conform used to get
        promoted as if it were the whole asset). A meta file written by
        pre-round-7 code never carries this key, so ``.get(...)`` on it
        naturally reads False too -- a legacy short entry self-heals into a
        MISS (and gets correctly re-conformed) rather than staying silently
        wrong.

        ``loudness_method`` (U20): which loudnorm shape produced the ``.ts``
        this meta describes -- ``"two-pass"`` or ``"single-pass-fallback"``, or
        ``None`` when no loudnorm filter ran at all. Written by the same single
        choke point that sets ``full_asset_conform``
        (``_promote_conform_into_cache``, which every conform path funnels
        through), and read back by the cache-HIT path so a served segment's own
        record still says how its audio was conformed. The probe-only write in
        ``_prepare_segment`` -- which lands BEFORE any conform for this asset
        exists -- leaves it ``None``, which is the honest answer at that point:
        no conform has chosen a shape yet.

        ``only_if_absent`` (U65): publish this sidecar only if no sidecar for
        this key exists yet, atomically. Round-6's "the later promote's write
        replaces the whole sidecar with the real value" holds only WITHIN one
        ``_prepare_segment`` call -- that is where ``meta`` is read, and the
        probe branch is reached only when it read ``None``, so the probe's
        write always precedes this call's own promote. It does NOT hold across
        two concurrent prepares for the same asset, which is the ordinary case
        on a multi-channel station sharing one cache: prepare A reads ``meta``
        as ``None`` (cache cold) and starts its probe; prepare B finishes a
        whole-asset conform and promotes it; A's probe then finishes and its
        write here REPLACED B's sidecar, erasing ``full_asset_conform`` and
        ``loudness_method``. The next prepare then read the flag False and
        re-conformed the entire asset -- live 2026-09-29, three times in one
        8 h rung on a 4.4 h asset. The probe-only caller passes
        ``only_if_absent=True`` so this write can never clear markers it did
        not set; the promote caller leaves it False, because a promote's write
        is the authoritative one and must replace what it supersedes. This is
        a no-op in the uncontended case: with no sidecar on disk (the only
        state in which the probe branch runs single-threaded) the atomic
        create always succeeds. It falls back to replacing only when the
        existing file is not usable meta at all (unparseable or truncated),
        so a corrupt sidecar still self-heals rather than stranding every
        later prepare in a re-probe.

        The ride is tried FIRST on every normalized conform, because it is the
        only shape that holds the level across every 4-minute stretch of the
        window rather than only in the whole-program average.  It is attempted,
        never assumed: ``None`` means the ride could not run for this window
        (no numpy, no FFmpeg, no soxr in the build, a decode/encode failure, a
        failed program mux) and the caller must conform the window with
        ``loudnorm`` exactly as it did before U25 -- after ONE warning naming
        the source, the window and the reason.  A degradation is never a
        failure: a station whose host cannot ride still airs leveled audio.

        Cancellation is the one thing that is NOT a degradation.  A cancelled
        ride and a cancelled mux both re-raise as
        ``SourcePreparationCancelledError`` so a shutdown or pause stops this
        prepare the same way it stops a cancelled measurement or encode.

        Both intermediates are the ride's own to clean up: the ride's audio-only
        TS is unlinked in the ``finally`` (the mux stream-copies it, so nothing
        downstream needs it), and the caller's ``tmp_path`` is unlinked before a
        degradation return -- ``build_video_from_source_args`` carries no
        ``-y``, so a leftover file would make the fallback's own encode fail
        with "File exists" instead of airing the segment.

        U25 x U29 (merge resolution, U40): ``timeout_seconds``/``lower_priority``
        are U29's warm-only knobs, threaded through so a ride attempted by a
        conform-cache warm runs under the warm's duration-scaled budget and at
        the lowered priority -- both this window's leveler (``timeout_s``) and
        the program mux. ``None``/``False`` (every air-path caller) leave the
        call exactly as it was: the configured preparation timeout at normal
        priority, so an airing still fails closed fast.

        Returns ``_LOUDNESS_METHOD_RIDE`` when ``tmp_path`` holds the muxed
        program, or ``None`` to fall back.

        ``threads`` (item 66, revised): the warm-behind path
        (``_schedule_warm``) keeps the default ``1`` -- single-threaded, so a
        background warm can never starve the on-air encoder. The synchronous
        start-path call (the untrimmed-MISS branch in ``_prepare_segment``,
        reachable only when ``self._playout_trim_supported`` is True -- see
        the guard there) passes ``_foreground_thread_cap()`` instead: an
        Opus-review follow-up found the original fix's unconditional
        ``background=False`` (fully unthrottled) starved the ffmpeg-concat
        engine's synchronous content-reload prepare (``daemon.py``'s
        ``_try_content_reload``, which runs this call ON the automation
        thread while other channels may be on air) -- a bounded cap keeps
        the synchronous path fast without letting it claim every core.

        Returns ``None`` instead of conforming (item 66 round-4 BLOCKER fix,
        Opus review) when this key's per-key lock is already held --
        virtually always ``_schedule_warm``'s background job already
        conforming the identical asset. This lock used to be acquired with a
        BLOCKING ``with`` statement: a background warm holds it for its
        entire single-threaded conform (tens of minutes for a long asset),
        so a synchronous caller landing here while that warm is running
        would stall behind it for just as long -- exactly the kind of delay
        item 66 exists to close, just via lock contention instead of a
        direct synchronous conform. Callers on the synchronous path
        (``_prepare_segment``'s untrimmed/``playout_trim_supported`` branch)
        must treat ``None`` as "fall back to the bounded per-segment conform
        instead of waiting"; ``_schedule_warm``'s own background job ignores
        the return value entirely (a warm colliding with another warm for
        the same key can't happen -- see its own dedupe -- so ``None`` there
        would only mean an unrelated caller is already populating this exact
        entry, which is fine to leave to that caller).

        U20 adds a SECOND ``None`` case to the same contract: the loudnorm
        measurement pass for the whole asset failed or returned unusable
        metadata, so this call degraded to the single-pass filter
        (``_measure_loudnorm_metadata`` logged ONE warning and returned
        ``"single-pass-fallback"``). A single-pass artifact must never occupy
        the whole-asset cache entry -- see that branch's own comment -- so this
        method returns ``None`` before writing anything, and the caller falls
        through to its bounded per-segment conform exactly as it does for lock
        contention. Both ``None`` cases mean the same thing to every caller
        ("this call did not populate ``{key}``"); neither is an error.

        U29 adds ``timeout_seconds``/``lower_priority`` as pass-through knobs
        for the warm path only. They are parameters rather than a computed
        scaling here on purpose: this method is ALSO called synchronously from
        ``_prepare_segment``'s untrimmed-MISS branch, on the air path, and
        computing a duration-scaled budget inside would silently change the
        air path's timeout -- which U29 must not do. Defaults keep that
        caller exactly as it was; see ``warm_preparation_timeout_seconds``.

        U25 puts the speech leveling ride FIRST here too, with ``segment=None``
        (the whole asset) and the same ``tmp``/promote tail: a ridden window is
        promoted through ``loudness_method="ride"`` exactly as a two-pass one
        is promoted through ``"two-pass"``, and a ride that could not run
        degrades to the loudnorm path below it with ONE warning
        (``_ride_conform_tmp``), never to a ``None`` return.

        U25 x U29 (merge resolution, U40): BOTH knobs are threaded into every
        stage this method runs -- they reach ``_ride_conform_tmp`` (its window
        leveler's ``timeout_s`` and its program mux) as well as the loudnorm
        fallback's ``_measure_loudnorm_metadata`` and conform encode. U29's
        point is that a warm's budget scales with the asset; a ride that
        ignored the knobs would be killed at the flat foreground bound on
        exactly the long assets the warm exists for, and would then pay for the
        loudnorm path as well. The air path still passes neither knob, so its
        fail-closed-fast behaviour is unchanged.

        per-plan file via a hard link (``os.link``) -- never by moving
        ``finished_output_path`` itself. The segment is airing from that
        exact path; this method must never make it disappear.

        Round-4 (Opus review), point 1: the per-key lock is now acquired
        NON-BLOCKING. A background warm holds this SAME lock for its
        entire single-threaded conform (tens of minutes for a long asset);
        a blocking acquire here meant a synchronous caller could stall
        behind an in-progress warm for just as long. If the lock is
        already held, the promotion is skipped entirely (logged) -- the
        segment already airs from ``finished_output_path`` regardless, so
        skipping costs nothing except that this one airing's copy is (for
        now) absent from the persistent cache; the in-progress warm (or
        the next airing) populates it instead.

        Round-5 (Opus review) BLOCKER fix: linking is a metadata-only
        filesystem operation (fast) and still runs inline; but when it
        FAILS (e.g. the cache lives on a different volume than the
        per-plan directory), the full byte-for-byte copy is handed to the
        warm scheduler (``_schedule_cache_copy_promotion``) -- and that
        scheduling now happens ONLY AFTER this method's own lock is fully
        released (the ``lock.release()`` in ``finally`` below runs before
        the scheduling call, never after). Round 4 scheduled the copy job
        from INSIDE the still-held lock: the queued job itself
        blocking-acquired the SAME lock, so a synchronous
        ``warm_scheduler`` (the job runs inline, before this frame's
        ``finally`` could ever run) was a guaranteed self-deadlock, and
        even the real threaded scheduler head-of-line-blocked its single
        worker on a lock THIS caller was still holding.

        Any OTHER failure here (a failed link, or
        ``_promote_conform_into_cache``'s own over-budget
        ``SourcePrepareError``) is logged and swallowed, never raised: the
        segment is already safely on air from ``finished_output_path``
        regardless. The only cost of a promotion failure is that the NEXT
        airing of this asset misses the cache and re-conforms, exactly

        scheduling from inside a still-held lock was a self-deadlock with

        the same way two warms for the same key already are.

        The queued job itself acquires the lock NON-BLOCKING too: on
        contention (a warm, or another copy-promotion job, already holds
        this key's lock) it skips outright rather than waiting or
        immediately re-queuing itself -- a naive re-queue with nothing
        else in the queue would busy-loop the single warm worker for as
        long as the contending operation runs, potentially tens of minutes
        for a warm's full-asset conform. Skipping costs nothing: whatever
        holds the lock is already populating this exact cache entry.

        plan, and an item shorter than the rollover lead collapses the
        next dispatch onto the current plan's own start -- so the incoming
        plan's cold whole-asset conform has the length of the OUTGOING plan as
        its entire runway (measured: a 290s government item, a 383.6s
        first-time conform, ~100s of slate). The automation cannot dispatch any
        earlier; what it CAN do is start the encode long before it dispatches.
        This is the entry point for that: the automation hands the daemon a
        boundary's plan while its own dispatch is still a full lead away, and
        the cache entry the air path will need is resident by the time the
        reload's synchronous prepare asks for it.

        It deliberately does NOT reimplement conforming. Each segment is handed
        to :meth:`_prepare_segment` as a synthetic UNTRIMMED whole-asset
        segment -- the real source path, no in/out points, and the probed media
        duration as its length -- so every derivation the live air path makes
        (the cache key, the loudnorm probe window, the conform arguments, the
        whole-asset promotion gate) runs unchanged and this can never populate
        the cache with an artifact the air path would not have produced itself.
        The jobs are queued on the same single-worker warm FIFO
        ``_schedule_warm`` uses, at lowered priority and on a duration-scaled
        budget, and they share its per-key dedupe and failure backoff: a warm
        already running for an asset makes a later one a no-op, and one that
        fails does not become an immediately-retried loop.

        Best-effort by construction. This is called from the automation's
        dispatch tick; it must never raise into it, so every per-segment
        decision is defensive and the whole body is bounded by the queue's own

        directory surviving to the next prepare's GC pass.

        Three layers, in order:

        1. **Keep-N-most-recent** (``_PREPARED_PLAN_DIR_KEEP_N``, by directory
           mtime) is NEVER eligible for removal here, regardless of size or age
           -- one of these could plausibly still be the plan a live worker is
           reading, or one the daemon has armed but not yet confirmed settled.
           ``keep`` (the caller's own actively-tracked directories, e.g. the
           daemon's current on-air plan) is unioned into this protected set,
           so an explicitly-tracked directory is never swept even if it is
           somehow older than the N most recent by mtime.
        2. **Byte budget** (``_prepared_plan_dir_budget_bytes``) across
           whatever is left after (1): oldest-first eviction until the
           channel's ``prepared/`` tree (excluding the protected set) is back
           under budget.
        3. **Age floor** (``_PREPARED_PLAN_DIR_MAX_AGE_S``, 24h) as an absolute
           last resort for anything (1) and (2) did not already catch -- a
           directory this old was very likely already reclaimed by (2) on a
           channel with any reload cadence at all; this floor exists for the
           degenerate case of a channel that barely reloads, where the byte
           budget alone might never trigger.

        F6 (same follow-up): also removes any PRE-UPGRADE flat
        ``prepared/segment-NNNN.ts``/``.tmp`` file sitting directly under
        ``channel_prepared_root`` itself (never inside a plan subdirectory) --
        the layout this fix replaced. Safe unconditionally: no code path
        written after this fix ever reads from that flat location again, and a

        H5 fix (measured on real hardware, tester soak): before this fix every
        ``prepare()`` call for a channel wrote its non-cached/trim-copy output to
        the SAME fixed path (``<channel>/prepared/segment-NNNN.ts``, keyed only by
        segment INDEX within its own call, never by which plan the call was
        preparing). For the GStreamer engine (``playout_trim_supported=False``),
        a content-reload's ``prepare()`` call for the NEWLY-due plan therefore
        wrote directly over the exact file the CURRENTLY LIVE worker's ``filesrc``
        was still reading for the plan already on air -- no GStreamer warning, no
        error, just a truncated/rewritten file underneath a live read, surfacing
        only as a downstream ``CTRL stall: no output for 10s`` on the worker with
        nothing in its own log pointing at the cause. Every call now gets its own
        uniquely-named subdirectory (``<channel>/prepared/<uuid>/segment-NNNN.ts``)
        so two ``prepare()`` calls -- however close together, however they
        overlap in wall-clock time -- can never share an output path. See
        ``_gc_prepared_plan_dirs`` for how the resulting directories are
        eventually reclaimed (keep-N-most-recent + a byte budget + an age
        floor as a last resort -- F3 fix), ``release`` for how a caller that
        independently knows a plan is retired can reclaim it immediately, and
        each write site's own comments for the accompanying atomic-write fix

        like real media.

        Two checks, both cheap: the file exists and is non-empty, and ffprobe can

        with no decodable stream. A stream listing is a container read, not a
        decode, so this costs one ffprobe per unique (path, in, out) segment.

        An UNANSWERABLE probe is not evidence of bad media: ``None`` from
