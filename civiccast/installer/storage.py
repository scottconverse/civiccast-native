"""Managed local durable storage for first-mile installs.

This module is the non-technical operator path for storage bootstrap. If a
station has not supplied DATABASE_URL, CivicCast provisions a local durable
SQLite database, applies the same Alembic migration graph, and records the
result in a small installer-owned state file. Technical admins can still point
DATABASE_URL at Postgres; the default path no longer asks meeting staff to do
that work by hand.

#: Hard wall-clock ceiling on the whole external-database probe, enforced by
#: :func:`civiccast.db.guarded_connect.run_bounded` (a thread the caller
#: ABANDONS on expiry) rather than by any driver-level timeout hint --
#: BLOCKER #52 measured psycopg v3's own ``connect_timeout`` NOT reliably
#: bounding a blackholed connect on this platform (~130s observed), and
#: :func:`civiccast.schema_check.read_db_revision`'s own inner ceiling is
#: 15s, chosen for the D3 upgrade engine and app startup rather than for an
#: endpoint a GUI polls. ``/installer/summary`` is polled by the installer
#: window (``apps/installer/src/App.tsx`` refreshes on a 2s and a 3s timer),
#: so this seam needs its OWN, tighter bound; the inner 15s constant is
#: deliberately NOT changed, because its other two callers are not on a poll
#: loop and a shorter bound there could abort a legitimate slow upgrade probe.
#:
#: 5 seconds, chosen against MEASURED numbers on this platform rather than
#: intuition -- a stopped database is NOT the fast case it looks like:
#:
#: * healthy database, revision read end to end: ~0.02s (executed).
#: * raw TCP connect to a CLOSED loopback port: 2.05s before Windows reports
#:   ConnectionRefusedError -- not immediate, even on 127.0.0.1.
#: * ``read_db_revision`` against that same closed port: 10.47s, because
#:   psycopg keeps retrying until its own ``connect_timeout=10`` hint expires.
#:
#: So the ordinary "the operator has not started Postgres yet" case ALREADY
#: exceeds any acceptable budget for a polled endpoint; this ceiling is what
#: turns that 10.47s into a bounded 5s, and a blackholed endpoint's ~130s
#: (BLOCKER #52's measurement) into the same 5s. 5s rather than something
#: tighter because a refused connect alone costs 2.05s here, and a cold remote
#: connect (DNS + TLS + auth) needs headroom above that before CivicCast is
#: entitled to call a merely-slow database unreachable.
_EXTERNAL_DATABASE_PROBE_CEILING_SECONDS = 5.0

#: How long one probe result is reused. Without this, the 2s GUI poll would
#: start a fresh 5s probe faster than the previous one can finish whenever the
#: database is blackholed, and ``run_bounded`` ABANDONS the thread it gives up
#: on -- the endpoint would stay bounded but the process would accumulate one
#: stuck connect thread every poll. 10s keeps at most one probe in flight in
#: that state while still turning the readiness screen green within one
#: operator glance after Postgres actually starts.
