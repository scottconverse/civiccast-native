"""BETA.10 U16 item B: the daemon's output A/V sync guard.

The U16 finding (2026-09-24) is a one-sided rebase step: the GStreamer engine's
content reload moved ONE leg's timestamps and left the other alone, so the
program leaving the encoder had its audio and its video offset by ~109s. Nothing
in the egress path looked at the OUTPUT program's own A/V relationship, so the
only place that step was ever visible was a human watching the channel.

This guard is the cheap output-side self-check: for a channel that is genuinely
ON AIR, every ~30s, measure the first packet PTS of video and of audio in the
newest COMPLETE segment of the channel's HLS window. A one-off difference is
normal (segment cuts land on video keyframes, and the audio in a cut segment can
legitimately lead or lag by a fraction of a frame). A difference that persists
across three consecutive probes is a fault the operator cannot fix and the
channel cannot air through, so the guard restarts that channel's WORKER -- the
same restart a dead encoder gets -- under a hard budget (3 restarts per channel
per rolling hour, then ERROR every 10 minutes and no restart).

Three disciplines this file pins, all inherited from U12's relay probe:

* Tri-state by presence. ``None`` from the probe means "no measurement" (no
  complete segment yet, a segment missing one of the kinds, ffprobe absent,
  failed, or timed out). It NEVER advances the streak, never resets it, and can
  never by itself restart anything -- a broken probe tool must not become a
  restart source.
* Never judge a channel that is not ON_AIR. A STARTING or FALLBACK_SLATE
  channel has no settled output to judge, and a channel mid-reload reads
  TRANSITIONING because the rebase step legitimately moves A/V against each
  other for a moment.
* Reset the streak when the worker pid changes. Measurements describe the
  worker that produced them; a replacement worker's first segment says nothing
  about its predecessor's last one.
