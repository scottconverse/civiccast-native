"""The worker and the engine must bind ONE copy of the graph dataclasses —
without the worker importing the ``civiccast`` package.

Gate A T4 root cause (2026-09): ``worker.py`` imported its sibling modules BY
PATH (``import graph``) while ``engine.py`` prefers the package form
(``from civiccast.egress.gst.graph import ...``). On the native Windows line the
bundled GStreamer runtime makes the engine's ``gi`` import succeed, so the two
halves bound two DISTINCT ``PlaylistLeg`` classes compiled from the same file.
``engine._instantiate_source_leg``'s ``isinstance(leg, PlaylistLeg)`` dispatch
then missed on every program leg (``bridge.graph_from_config`` always builds a
``PlaylistLeg``), fell through to the ``SourceLeg`` branch and raised
``AttributeError: 'PlaylistLeg' object has no attribute 'elements'`` inside
``GstPlayoutEngine.__init__`` — before the pipeline ever reached PLAYING, so the
udp-ts sink never emitted a single MPEG-TS packet.

``worker._sibling_module`` fixes that by publishing each by-path module under its
package name in ``sys.modules``, which the engine's package-form import then
resolves to. The two properties that matter are tested here:

* **identity** — both halves see one ``PlaylistLeg``;
* **isolation** — ``worker.py``'s import block still imports NO ``civiccast``
  package module, so ``civiccast/egress/__init__.py`` (771 modules, sqlalchemy +
  pydantic) never lands in the worker process. A package-first import would have
  fixed the identity split and broken exactly this.

Scope note, measured rather than assumed: this covers ``worker.py``'s OWN
imports. The worker process as a whole is not pydantic-free today — ``engine.py``
imports ``civiccast.native.gstreamer_runtime`` to bootstrap the bundled closure
and ``civiccast/native/__init__.py`` re-exports a pydantic module. That is
engine.py's import, it predates this seam, and it is out of scope here.

The engine module imports ``gi``, which is not installed in this test
environment (it lives only in the shipped GStreamer closure), so the engine is
stubbed in ``sys.modules`` under its PACKAGE name — which is also exactly the
"already imported, adopt it" branch of ``_sibling_module``.
