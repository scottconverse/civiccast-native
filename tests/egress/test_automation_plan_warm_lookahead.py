"""U60: a plan SHORTER than the rollover lead strands its successor's preparation.

Live C10, 2026-09-27 21:17:42. The station rolls one scheduled item per plan
(``civiccast/egress/source_plan.py``: ``max_segments=1`` on the GStreamer path),
so the plan on air is one item long. The rollover trigger is

    ``max(last_segment_start_at, plan_end_at - lead)``

and for an item shorter than ``lead`` (690s at the station's 300s preparation
timeout -- see ``_rollover_lead_seconds``) the first term wins: the dispatch for
the NEXT boundary fires the instant the CURRENT plan settles, which is also the
instant that dispatch's own synchronous cold conform starts. The preparation's
whole runway is therefore the length of the plan on air -- measured live at 290s
for a government item whose first-time conform took 383.6s. The plan ran to EOS
with no reload in flight, the worker held the slate for ~100s, and the next
dispatch inherited the delay: a latched lateness cascade.

The fix is an off-air LOOK-AHEAD warm. On EVERY dispatch, the automation walks
the boundaries ahead and asks the daemon to warm the first one whose own
dispatch is still a full lead away -- so the cache entry the air path will need
is already resident when the reload's synchronous prepare runs. A boundary
whose dispatch is nearer than ``now + lead`` is deliberately NOT warmed: it
cannot finish in time, and warming it would run a second whole-asset conform
concurrently with the reload's own cold conform. U63 preserves one
collapsed-boundary case: when the next item's dispatch collapses onto the
boundary being dispatched now, the daemon warms it immediately because there
is no earlier dispatch opportunity.

BETA.10 U61 (2026-09-27): the look-ahead was first gated to the recovery regime
alone -- a leg SHORTER than the lead -- and that excluded the ordinary cadence
case, which is where a long title needs it most. Live: government aired a 9020s
meeting (Sustainability Advisory Board - April 2026) as 1800s slices. 1800s of
plan against a 690s lead is NOT ``inside_lead_recovery``, so the look-ahead
never ran once -- zero look-ahead lines in any station log, no ``warm/`` scratch
under any channel -- and every slice paid its own cold bounded conform (383.6s /
406.0s / 458.5s / 293.6s / 267.0s). The whole-asset conform that would have made
every slice after the first a stream-copy HIT is exactly what the walk asks for,
and in this regime the walk never ran at all. The gate is now
``lead_seconds is not None`` alone,
and the walk's own ``dispatch_at >= now + lead`` test is what keeps a racing
boundary out, in this regime exactly as in the recovery one.

This test drives ``ChannelAutomationService`` directly, mirroring
``tests/egress/test_automation_rollover_retry_log_cadence.py``'s harness. No
station is touched and the engine's changeover code is not exercised.

    Two bounds, both about the largest whole-asset conform this box has staged
    (public's 15949.199933s City Council, ``757519c3...``):

    * ``_CONFORM_SECONDS_AT_BENCH_RATE`` -- that asset divided by the standalone
      16.3x realtime recorded at ``preparer.py:96``: 978s.
    * ``_CONFORM_SECONDS_LIVE_LARGEST_MEASURED`` -- the same conform's ACTUAL
      duration on the station, which is the number the deployed station pays and
      the tighter of the two.

    The live number is readable off the filesystem and nowhere else, because the
    warm path logs nothing on success. It works because
    ``_promote_conform_into_cache`` does ``tmp.replace(final)`` -- a RENAME into
    the cache, not a copy (``preparer.py:1240``, whose docstring calls itself
    "the SOLE place a ``.ts`` is ever renamed into the persistent cache"). A
    within-volume rename preserves NTFS creation time, so a cache ``.ts`` is
    born when the conform's OUTPUT was created and its sidecar ``.json`` is born
    when the meta is written straight after the rename: the birth-to-birth gap
    IS the whole-asset conform, and a hit's ``os.utime`` refresh shows up as a
    LATER ``.ts`` mtime than ``.json`` birth. Read that way, the box measured:

    * City Council Aug 11 ``757519c3``: 21:47:44.434 -> 22:04:47.236 over
      15949.199933s = 1022.8s = 15.6x
    * Sustainability ``8564fe6c``: 23:01:45.660 -> 23:10:37.863 over
      9020.834s = 532.2s = 17.0x
    * NSF Day After Tomorrow ``e6b580bf``: 22:15:31.457 -> 22:22:18.293 over
      5334.814s = 406.8s = 13.1x

    So the live whole-asset rate is 13.1-17.0x -- essentially the bench rate, not
    slower -- and the largest whole-asset conform this box has ever been measured
    staging is 1022.8s, against the 16.3x prediction of 978s for the same asset.
    (The only larger gap on the box, ``80cdcd4c``'s 110.6s, is a probe-only
    sidecar -- ``full_asset_conform: false``, ``media_duration_seconds: null`` --
    and is not a whole-asset conform at all.)

    The runway from this dispatch to the warmed boundary's OWN dispatch has to
    cover that. The air-path warm is the SAME job asked for later: it leaves
    ``_prepare_segment`` only once that slice's own conform has finished, so its
    window is this runway minus one slice conform (measured 267-458s tonight),
    and on a single starved FIFO it was still racing when the next slice's cold
    conform took the box.

    What this does NOT prove: that the warm is always SCHEDULED early enough to
    spend this runway. The runway itself covers the conform with room to spare
    (1790s against 1023s measured; the break-even is an asset of roughly 8h,
    longer than anything that has aired here). What ate the runway live was the
    SCHEDULING -- the gate never fired (no warm was ever asked for at a dispatch
    tick) and the one global FIFO plus a daemon restart delayed the entry by
    ~100 minutes. That part is the next lever and is not fixed here; see
    ``reports/U61.md``.
