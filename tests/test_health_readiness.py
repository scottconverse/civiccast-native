"""Policy: ``/health`` must not report "healthy" for a station that cannot work.

GauntletGate W-1 + T1 (Major, 2026-07-21). ``GET /health`` returned
``{"status":"healthy", ..., "schema":"not-configured"}`` on a station with no
database at all, and ``tests/test_schema_check.py`` asserted that pairing as the
expected contract -- so the suite locked the defect in. An uptime monitor or load
balancer polling ``/health`` saw a green station that could not serve a single
recording.

The contract these tests pin:

* ``/health`` is a LIVENESS probe: it answers **200 whenever the process is up**,
  in every schema state. The installer's Rust probe
  (``health_response_is_ok`` in ``src-tauri/src/main.rs``) requires 200, and a
  station mid-setup is alive-but-not-ready by design.
* ``status`` is the READINESS signal: ``healthy`` only when the database schema
  matches the code (``schema == "current"``); ``degraded`` otherwise -- whether
  the schema is missing, behind, or unverifiable.
* Readiness is re-evaluated when durable storage is activated mid-flight, so a
  station that just finished "Prepare storage" reports ``healthy`` WITHOUT a
  restart. Without this, ``degraded`` would be permanently sticky.
