"""Contract for the operator-facing behaviour of the NSIS bootstrap hooks.

`nsis-hooks-bootstrap.nsh` is the ONE live native installer hook file (see its
own header, and `tests/policy/test_native_installer_identity.py` for the pin on
that fact). It is NSIS script, not Python or Rust, so -- following the
source-shape convention `test_native_service_start.py` and
`test_tauri_windows_manifest.py` already use in this directory -- the contract
pinned here is the SHAPE of the script text: which exit codes each step
branches on, which branches route to the fail-loud `CIVICCAST_FAIL` macro, and
what the operator-visible remedy text actually says.

Both defects covered here were found on real hardware on 2026-08-01, not in the
pristine Windows Sandbox that every prior proof run used:

  * chain E -- the vc-redist step hard-failed the whole install on MSI exit
    1638 (ERROR_PRODUCT_VERSION, "another version of this product is already
    installed"), which for the VC++ redistributable bootstrapper is the NORMAL
    state of a machine that already carries a same-or-newer runtime. The
    prerequisite is satisfied; the install aborted anyway.

  * chain F -- the stage-packs failure dialog offered a remedy the product does
    not implement ("connect this machine to the network so setup can download
    them"). The hook's own comment says the online path is a typed
    NOT_AVAILABLE outcome today because no channel index URL is pinned anywhere
    in this codebase.
