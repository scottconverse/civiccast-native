"""Migration 0086 (live-source probe state) applies, backfills, and reverses.

``create_all`` (the store fixtures) builds the schema from the ORM, so every
other WP-07 test would pass even if the MIGRATION were broken. These tests
drive the actual alembic upgrade.

The backfill assertion is the one that matters operationally: an existing
station has configured sources today, and after this migration they must land
on ``never_probed`` -- "nobody has looked yet" -- rather than inheriting a
readiness claim nothing ever verified. Upgrading straight into "everything is
ready" would reproduce the exact defect this revision exists to close.
