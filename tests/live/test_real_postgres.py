"""Real-Postgres tests for the v0.4 live-broadcast spine migration.

Sprint 0.4 Slice 1 Commit 3. Proves migration 0007_live_sessions:

- ``alembic upgrade head`` creates the three live tables in the
  ``civiccast`` schema.
- The DB-level CHECK constraints reject invalid state / source_type
  values.
- ``alembic downgrade 0006_widen_asset_state_check`` drops the three
  live tables cleanly.
- ``alembic upgrade head`` is a single graph (one head) even though
  the new migration lives under ``civiccast/live/migrations/versions/``
  rather than ``civiccast/schedule/migrations/versions/``.

Skip-marked when Docker / testcontainers is unavailable, matching the
pattern in ``tests/schedule/test_real_postgres.py``.

    """Locks: the per-module migration layout produces exactly one
    Alembic head. Two heads would indicate accidental fork in the
    revision graph (e.g., 0007 with the wrong down_revision).

    HABIT NOTE (Tests lens of the 5-lens self-audit, 2026-05-12 after
    `14d1018` shipped a migration without updating the hardcoded head
    string below and the CI gate caught it):

    The string-equality assertion below is a deliberate tripwire. It
    fires whenever the live-module Alembic head advances. The fire is
    correct -- the test is doing its job. The fix is also mechanical:
    update the string + the inline comment to the new head's revision
    id. The lesson is in the 5-lens audit, not the test:

    **Any migration that advances or renames the head MUST grep the
    repo for the OUTGOING head string (e.g. `"0009_live_sources_index"`)
    before commit. Hits in `tests/` are tripwires that need the same
    diff; hits in `civiccast/` migrations are load-bearing
    `down_revision` chains that must not be touched.** A 60-second
    grep is the audit step that prevents this whole class of failure
    from reaching CI.

    Each rename leaves a one-line trail below ("Updated to ... in
    <commit-sha>") so future grep'ers see the history of advances and
    don't have to git-blame to reconstruct it."""

    under real-Postgres concurrency.

    Two threads call ``finalize_recording`` on the same ``ending``-state
    session at the same time. The composite-PK UNIQUE on
    ``live_session_events`` serializes them: one INSERT wins and commits
    the transaction (event + asset + state advance); the other's INSERT
    collides on the PK, rolls back, and returns
    ``FinalizationResult(idempotent=True)`` after re-reading the winner's
    rows. Exactly one asset row exists at end-of-test; exactly one event
    row exists; the LiveSession is at ``recorded``.

    This proof matters because the SQLite test path in
    :mod:`tests.live.test_finalization` cannot demonstrate true row-
    level contention (SQLite serializes all writers at the database
    level). Sprint 0.4 Slice 1 Commit 7 design directive.

# S26 paywall — real-Postgres functional coverage (T-2 fix from the
# S26 GauntletGate Test/QA lane).
#
# The SQLite-only paywall tests pass tz-naive datetimes through SQLAlchemy
# and quietly behave differently from real PG (`DateTime(timezone=True)`
# round-trips aware datetimes on PG, naive on SQLite). These cases pin
# the four PG-side behaviors that the audit identified as untested:
#
#  1. ``has_grant_for`` correctly excludes a tz-aware expired grant.
#  2. ``revoke_grants_for_subscription`` reports the correct rowcount
#     under psycopg's autocommit / transactional semantics.
#  3. The unique-station-config index rejects a second config from a
#     concurrent writer (two sessions; second raises IntegrityError).
#  4. Webhook event-id idempotency (Q-1): replaying the same event id
#     short-circuits the second call.

# S21 scheduled recording — real-Postgres functional coverage.
#
# T-1 fix (S21 Test/QA lane): the merge revision 0060_recording_paywall_merge
# previously had NO real-PG coverage of the recording tables — only
# SQLite. Real PG can fail catastrophically where SQLite shrugs (FK
# ordering, default-value seed re-apply on re-upgrade, JSON column
# default semantics). This class pins:
#
#  1. ``upgrade head`` on a real PG creates ``recording_schedules`` +
#     ``recording_jobs`` in the ``civiccast`` schema.
#  2. The ``recording_jobs_state_check`` CHECK constraint rejects an
#     invalid ``state`` value on real PG.
#  3. The ``(station_id, name)`` unique constraint on
#     ``recording_schedules`` rejects a second config from a concurrent
#     writer (two sessions; second raises IntegrityError).
#  4. ``downgrade 0055_asrun_and_epg`` drops the two recording tables
#     cleanly on real PG (no FK-ordering surprise).
#
# T-3 fix (S21 Test/QA lane): ``find_overlapping_jobs`` carries a
# ``_coerce_aware`` branch that converts SQLite's tz-naive datetimes
# into aware UTC. On real PG (``DateTime(timezone=True)`` round-trips
# aware), the conversion should be a no-op. The TestRealPostgresPaywall
# class already documented this exact bug class for the paywall T-2
# fix — replicate the pattern here so an aware/naive comparison
# mismatch under SQLite doesn't slip through to PG. The fifth test
# below plants two jobs with aware datetimes on real PG and asserts
# overlap detection works.
