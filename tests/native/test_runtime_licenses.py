"""Red-first tests for the per-file license classifier (`runtime_licenses`).

This module is deliberately independent of `runtime_manifest.py` (a
different worker owns that file concurrently) -- these tests exercise
`civiccast.native.runtime_licenses` in isolation, against the evidence
recorded in `.agent-runs/native-windows/ws5-packaging-closure/evidence/
license-provenance.md`:

- Direct `gst_plugin_get_license()` queries against the actual DLLs in the
  built tree (see the evidence memo's "Plugin sweep" section) for every one
  of the 34 GStreamer plugin DLLs the closure ships.
- Direct `avutil_license()` / `avcodec_license()` / `avformat_license()` /
  `avfilter_license()` / `swscale_license()` / `swresample_license()` calls
  against the shipped FFmpeg DLLs.
- The wheel-cache `dist-info/METADATA` `License:` fields for all seven
  installed GStreamer distributions plus the two EXCLUDED
  `gstreamer_plugins_gpl*` distributions (confirmed absent from
  `requirements-native-runtime.txt`).

AC7 (`spec-packaging-closure`): an unresolved file must come back `None`,
never a guessed default. `is_gpl_license` is the explicit GPL-detection
predicate the investigation's core question depends on.
