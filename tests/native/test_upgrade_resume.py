"""Resume-from-each-boundary idempotency (simulated power loss at every phase).

A kill is simulated by constructing a journal persisted at a mid-flight phase
(with the world left in the state that phase implies) and re-running
``run_upgrade``. The re-run must COMPLETE cleanly (forward phases) or, when the
recorded phase is past the mutation frontier and the remaining steps fail, ROLL
BACK cleanly — never leave a half state. This is the core auditability property
of the slice.
