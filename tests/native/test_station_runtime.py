    """``direct_layout=True`` writes the station straight at ``root`` (no
    ``app/<version>`` wrapping) -- the fresh-install shape the installer's
    payload extraction actually produces (no junction, no version-named
    directory; that layer belongs to the post-tag upgrade engine's
    junction-flip design, see civiccast.native.upgrade.junction). Defaults to
    the existing junction/version-root shape so every pre-existing caller is
    unaffected.

    Owner-ratified two-pack contract (2026-08-07): the ``captions-floor``
    pack is MANDATORY and is therefore ALWAYS declared in the written
    ``station-set.json``'s pack inventory, matching
    ``native_activation.rs``'s ``REQUIRED_COMPONENTS``. ``captions-large-v3``
    is OPTIONAL -- ``write_large_v3=False`` omits BOTH its model bytes on
    disk AND its pack entry from the inventory (a real floor-only station's
    manifest never carries a ``captions-large-v3`` pack at all), matching
    ``OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS``.

    The receipt's ``caption_inference`` block defaults to the REAL
    (never-monkeypatched) large-v3 identity -- what a real receipt looks
    like whenever large-v3 is the tier that actually ran, and unaffected by
    a test that monkeypatches only the FLOOR entry of ``CAPTION_TIER_REGISTRY``
    (see ``_fake_floor_registry``, which always leaves large-v3 untouched). A
    floor-only test that needs the receipt to instead claim the floor
    identity overwrites it afterward with
    ``_replace_receipt_caption_inference`` once the floor tier's real staged
    bytes (and, where used, a fake registry) are known -- ``_write_station``
    itself cannot know that identity in advance, since floor bytes are
    written by a separate helper called after this one returns."""
