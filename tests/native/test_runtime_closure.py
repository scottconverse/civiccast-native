"""Red-first tests for the native Windows runtime packaging closure.

Covers `spec-packaging-closure` D2 (closure = static PE walk + resources),
D3 (no GPL in the shipped runtime), and AC3 (GPL negative control).

The closure core is deliberately pure: the PE-import walk takes `imports_of`
and `resolve` as injected callables so the graph logic is provable without any
real PE file, and the same functions run against `pefile` in the build script.
