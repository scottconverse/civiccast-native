"""Native installer product identity (spec D1 / SDR-004).

CivicCast (Native) is the only installer product this repository ships. The
WSL2 lane ("CivicCast Installer", the base tauri.conf.json built WITHOUT the
native overlay) was retired under the owner's "no linux" decision
(2026-08-19); its hook file, nsis-hooks.nsh, is deleted, and the base
config no longer declares any installerHooks of its own.

The native product is still built as a Tauri v2 config OVERLAY in the same
app (``tauri.native.conf.json`` + ``nsis-hooks-bootstrap.nsh``), merged over
the base ``tauri.conf.json`` by ``tauri build --config``, rather than a
forked app directory -- D1's "two products, one codebase" decision predates
the WSL lane's retirement, and the overlay mechanism itself did not change,
only the number of real products that use it.

These tests assert:

1. the native NSIS hook set contains ZERO WSL-touching steps -- a permanent
   regression guard, not a two-product disjointness check: if wsl.exe or
   distro-lifecycle code ever reappeared in the shipped hook set, this
   fails;
2. the EFFECTIVE (deep-merged) native config carries the native product's
   own identity, install mode, and hook file, computed the same way Tauri's
   CLI computes it, so an overlay that silently dropped an override would
   be caught; and
3. the native product installs perMachine (with elevation), per D1.

The base tauri.conf.json is kept only because Tauri's CLI always reads it as
the file a ``--config`` overlay merges on top of -- nothing in this
repository's build scripts or CI workflows ever builds it directly (see
``scripts/build_native_installer.py``'s own ``run_tauri_build()``, which
always passes ``--config``).

    convention -- SetErrors + alert + `Goto civiccast_bootstrap_postinstall_done`
    -- and passed happily while a failed install still reported SUCCESS. NSIS
    fires `.onInstFailed` only on a failed extraction or an explicit `Abort`;
    `SetErrors` is not a trigger, and Tauri's generated installer.nsi runs
    `.onInstSuccess` unconditionally. So the old convention was the defect, and
    a test pinning it was pinning the defect.

    Every failure branch now routes through CIVICCAST_FAIL, which sets a
    step-identifying error level and aborts. The unwind label is gone: a
    branch that merely jumps to a shared label is exactly the shape that let a
    broken machine finish on the wizard's completion page.

    Measured behavior this pins (see
    .agent-runs/native-windows/ws5-installer/evidence/nsis-errorlevel-probe/):

    a bare CIVICCAST_ALERT there would be indistinguishable from the

    CIVICCAST_NOTICE -- structurally identical delivery to CIVICCAST_ALERT
    but with no SetErrorLevel/Abort of its own, so it is incapable of masking

    """BLOCKER (2026-07-30, live Sandbox run 7): --civiccast-teardown-native-state
    was originally invoked from NSIS_HOOK_POSTUNINSTALL. But Tauri's OWN
    generated uninstall Section deletes the exact executable that CLI call
    needs, BEFORE POSTUNINSTALL ever runs:

        target/release/nsis/x64/installer.nsi:756
            Delete "$INSTDIR\\${MAINBINARYNAME}.exe"
        target/release/nsis/x64/installer.nsi:838
            !insertmacro NSIS_HOOK_POSTUNINSTALL

    (line 756 is inside `Section Uninstall`, strictly before line 838 in the
    same linear script -- there is no jump between them). So a teardown call
    living in POSTUNINSTALL can never actually run: nsExec::ExecToLog just
    fails to launch a file NSIS's own uninstall Section had already deleted a
    few lines earlier in the SAME generated script. The entire teardown --
    stop the service, remove the service, delete the firewall rule -- never
    ran, while the uninstall still reported exit 0. This precisely explains
    the observed Sandbox run 7 evidence: uninstall exited 0 while leaving the
    CivicCastSupervisor service registered, the TCP 8000 firewall rule open,
    and 12,145 files behind.

    NSIS_HOOK_PREUNINSTALL is inserted BEFORE that Delete:

        target/release/nsis/x64/installer.nsi:748-750

              !insertmacro NSIS_HOOK_PREUNINSTALL
            !endif

    -- i.e. at line 748, strictly before the line-756 Delete -- so the exe
    still exists there. This is independently provable from the hook file
    itself, without needing the generated installer.nsi at all: PREUNINSTALL's
    pre-existing ActiveRuntime ownership preflight (the ORIGINAL, unmoved
    code, not part of this fix) already depends on and successfully invokes
    that exact same executable at this same point in the chain -- proving the
    exe is present here, or that preflight could never have worked either.

    Fix: move the teardown invocation itself into PREUNINSTALL (after the
    ownership preflight gate, before the pre-existing taskkill), and carry its
    exit code to POSTUNINSTALL via a file-scope Var, since the recursive tree
    removal that gate controls must stay in POSTUNINSTALL (it can only run

    above only touched the STAGE-PACKS step's `DetailPrint "$1"`. The re-walk
    of b1c6fe4d still found the raw JSON manifest flooding the pane -- because
    the actual "Show details" control renders EVERY DetailPrint call NSIS
    fires while POSTINSTALL runs, and the D2 re-verification steps that run
    right after stage-packs (native-server-binaries, native-app-payload,
    native-ffmpeg-runtime, native-ollama-runtime) invoke
    `--civiccast-verify-pack-tree` via
    `nsExec::ExecToLog`, not `ExecToStack` -- a DIFFERENT NSIS plugin call
    that streams 100% of the child's stdout straight into the pane live, with
    no `Pop`/`DetailPrint` choke point to guard at all.

    On success, `run_native_install_verify_cli` (main.rs) serializes the
    FULL `VerifiedPack` -- including its complete `files: Vec<VerifiedPackFile
    { path, bytes, sha256 }>`, one entry per file in the pack (thousands for
    native-app-payload, which bridges to $INSTDIR\\runtime and carries the
    embedded Python payload: `Lib/site-packages/civiccast/alembic/__init__.py`
    is exactly this shape) -- via `serde_json::to_string_pretty` +
    `println!`. ExecToLog has no equivalent of ExecToStack's $1: there is no
    variable to inspect or gate before the pane renders it, so this is a
    STRICTLY WORSE version of the exact bug chain O fixed one step earlier in
    the same macro.

    This is why chain O's own test above could not have caught it: its
    `stage_packs_region` slice explicitly ENDS at the
    "D2 INSTALL-TIME RE-VERIFICATION" marker
    (`postinstall.index("D2 INSTALL-TIME RE-VERIFICATION", stage_packs_start)`),
    which excludes these four ExecToLog calls by construction. This test
    scans the FULL, unsliced postinstall block instead -- the same text that
    becomes the compiled installer.nsi that NSIS's own "Show details"
    listbox renders line-for-line -- so there is no seam left for a fixed
    step to hide a still-broken one beside it.
