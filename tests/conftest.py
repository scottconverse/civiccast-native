    and secrets locations from ``%LOCALAPPDATA%``, the XDG roots, or
    ``~/.civiccast``. Before this fixture existed, any test that built the
    production app without overriding each of those wrote a real
    ``civiccast.sqlite3``, lock files and secrets into the developer's own
    profile (and broke outright on a runner where that profile is read-only).

    exercised) created, removed or rewrote anything under the REAL state
    roots, the test fails at teardown naming the paths. That is what keeps an
    unknown resolver, or a hard-coded path, from silently editing the

    Verified cross-suite pollution: ``civiccast.native.supervisor.
    service_env.ensure_database_url_env`` writes ``os.environ["DATABASE_URL"]``
    directly -- by design, so the production service can bridge the
    installer-persisted registry value into its process env (see
    ``service_env.py``'s module docstring). Tests that exercise it first call
    ``monkeypatch.delenv(DATABASE_URL_ENV_VAR, raising=False)`` to start from
    a clean slate, but pytest's own ``MonkeyPatch.delitem``/``delenv`` is a
    documented no-op -- it records NO undo entry -- when the key is already
    absent. The first time a whole pytest process runs one of those tests,
    ``DATABASE_URL`` is unset, so the guarding ``delenv`` registers nothing to
    undo, and the raw write that follows (bypassing monkeypatch entirely) is
    never reverted: the value survives every later test in the same process.

    ``tests/native`` and ``tests/installer`` running together is exactly the
    case that exposes this. ``tests/native/test_service_env.py`` leaves
    ``DATABASE_URL=postgresql://from-registry/db`` (its fixture value) set for
    the rest of the session; every later installer test that calls
    ``civiccast.app.create_app()`` then picks up that ambient URL and tries to
    actually connect, breaking dozens of unrelated installer tests (auth,
    durable storage, ...). Each suite run alone never notices, because
    ``tests/installer`` alone never runs after the leaking native test.

    Rather than special-case ``DATABASE_URL``, this is a general backstop: it
    snapshots ``os.environ`` before each test and restores it byte-for-byte
    after, so ANY direct environment write left unrestored by test code (or
    by production code under test) cannot outlive the test that caused it.
    ``PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST`` is left alone -- pytest's own runner maintains it
    across the very setup/call/teardown phases this fixture wraps, and
    touching it here would race pytest's own bookkeeping for no benefit.
