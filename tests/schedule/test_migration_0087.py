"""WP-08 migration 0087_retention_terms.

Drives the real migration through Alembic against a fresh sqlite fixture
DB (not ``create_all`` -- that builds the *current* ORM schema and would
never catch a broken migration file). Covers upgrade, downgrade,
round-trip, single-head, and both backfill rules (permanent -> forever,
published_at -> retention_anchor_at) against production-shaped rows
inserted with raw SQL before the migration runs, per the finalization
plan's per-work-package completion gate ("backfill of production-shaped
existing rows").
