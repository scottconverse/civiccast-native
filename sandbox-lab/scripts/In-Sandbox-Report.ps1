# In-Sandbox-Report.ps1
# Runs INSIDE Windows Sandbox via the .wsb LogonCommand.
# Drives a silent install of the published CivicCast Native beta.1 installer,
# then collects a clean-box baseline: exit code, install tree, station-set.json,
# activation-self-test.json, CivicCastSupervisor service state, installer logs,
# and Event Log errors during the run window.
#
# Evidence path (changed by <gate-a-mapped-folder-stalls>, see the long note
# above the shipper below): every write lands in the LOCAL C:\CivicCastLocalOut
# and a separate shipper process mirrors that directory into the host-visible
# mapped folder C:\CivicCastOutput every few seconds, DONE.json last. The host
# launcher still polls C:\CivicCastOutput\DONE.json exactly as before -- the
# contract with the host is unchanged, only which process writes it is.
#
# HARDENED 2026-08-17 after a run that got all the way through a clean
# postinstall (verified via install-progress.log) but then hung for 6+
# minutes past _AFTER_INSTALL.marker with no summary.json ever written --
# the previous version did two full-tree `Get-ChildItem -Recurse` scans
# (once each for station-set.json / activation-self-test.json) over a
# 10,629-file / 5.4 GB install tree, which is exactly the kind of thing that
# is fast on a real disk and can take many minutes on Windows Sandbox's
# virtualized/differencing storage. Fixes in this version:
#   (a) summary.json is now written INCREMENTALLY after every numbered step
#       below (Save-Summary), so a hang anywhere after step N still leaves
#       steps 1..N's results on disk for the host to read.
#   (b) the two full-tree recursive searches are replaced with TARGETED,
#       bounded path checks (exact known locations + one shallow,
#       non-recursive listing of app\* subfolders) -- see Test-KnownPaths.
#   (c) the CivicCastSupervisor service check remains non-blocking
#       (Get-Service / sc.exe query / sc.exe qc, none of which wait), and a
#       Start-Service attempt (new) is wrapped in a bounded poll (max 60s)
#       instead of any unbounded wait.
#   (d) a DONE.json marker (not just the old DONE.marker text file) is
#       written as the LAST statement in the script -- Host-Launch-
#       Sandbox-Test.ps1 now polls for DONE.json specifically, so a stray
#       earlier marker (e.g. _AFTER_INSTALL.marker) can never be mistaken
#       for real completion again.

# HARDENED <gate-a-station-up-wait-and-log-capture>: bounded script-level
# watchdog. -MaxScriptMinutes defaults to 150 (LogonCommand invokes this
# script with no arguments, so the default always applies in production;
# it exists as a parameter purely so a developer/dry-run can shorten it).
# Deliberately NOT implemented with Start-Job -- service.py's own history
# (see comment near the Get-WinEvent call further down) documents a real
# System.OutOfMemoryException hit loading PSWorkflow/PSScheduledJob module
# type data the moment Start-Job was invoked under this VM's memory
# pressure, so the watchdog is a genuinely separate powershell.exe process
# (Start-Process) instead -- it never touches the job-scheduling subsystem.
#
# HARDENED <gate-a-mapped-folder-stalls>: the main script no longer writes
# ANYTHING to the Windows Sandbox mapped folder. Three independent Gate A
# runs stalled forever on a synchronous write to C:\CivicCastOutput -- the
# host-mapped (VSMB) share -- each at a different statement, each with the
# VM alive and every other process still healthy:
#
#   run3 (8579e66) stalled BETWEEN two consecutive ~30-byte Add-Content
#     appends to the same already-created mapped file (T3T5-RESULT.txt has
#     4 of its 9 expected lines; the 5th append never returned).
#   run4 (8579e66) and run6 (f31618f) both stalled in the 4-statement
#     window between Save-Summary 'station-diag-captured-after-t3t5' and
#     Save-Summary 'install-progress-log-copied' -- a Copy-Item onto an
#     existing mapped file plus a bounded read.
#   run6 is the decisive one: 42 minutes into the stall, the SEPARATE
#     watchdog powershell.exe successfully created two brand-new files in
#     the very same mapped folder. The share was NOT dead. What was dead
#     was this process's own in-flight I/O against it.
#
# So the failure mode is not "sustained I/O kills the share" (a 30-byte
# append wedged run3) and not "the share dies" (run6 disproves it). It is:
# a synchronous, uncancellable, timeout-less file operation issued by THIS
# process against a share this process does not control can wedge that
# thread permanently -- and this script runs the entire gate on one thread.
#
# The architectural answer is to take the share off the critical path
# entirely:
#   * $OutDir is now a LOCAL directory the VM fully owns. Every existing
#     $OutDir reference in this file -- the transcript, summary.json, every
#     T*-RESULT file, every station-diag capture, every redirected child
#     stdout/stderr, DONE.json -- writes there and can no longer wedge.
#   * $ShipDir is the mapped folder. A separate, disposable shipper
#     process mirrors $OutDir into it on a fixed tick; each tick is its own
#     short-lived child process, so a wedged tick costs one tick, never the
#     run (exactly the property run6's watchdog demonstrated).
#   * The watchdog reads and writes $OutDir too, so it can no longer be
#     blocked by the same surface it exists to bound.
#   * Host-Launch-Sandbox-Test.ps1 owns the last line of defence: if the
#     mapped folder goes quiet while the VM is alive, it declares a harness
#     error with its own marker rather than waiting out the full timeout.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The SHIPPER: the only thing in this run that writes to the mapped folder.
#
# A supervisor process spawns ONE short-lived tick child every
# $ShipIntervalSeconds. Each tick is a fresh powershell.exe with fresh
# handles -- the exact shape that provably kept working in run6 while the
# main script's own I/O was wedged -- so a tick that hangs on the share
# costs that tick and nothing else.
#
# Guard: the supervisor SKIPS a tick while the previous child is still
# running, but only up to 3 intervals. Past that the child is presumed
# wedged on the share, force-killed, and replaced -- a strict
# skip-forever guard would let one wedged tick stop shipping for the rest
# of the run, which is the failure this whole change exists to remove.
#
# Each tick writes _SHIPPER-HEARTBEAT.txt locally BEFORE mirroring, so a
# healthy tick always advances a timestamp on the host side even when the
# run is inside a quiet stretch (the T5 soak only advances a step every
# 5 minutes). Host-Launch-Sandbox-Test.ps1's quiet-share detector reads
# exactly that liveness.
#
# QUIESCE <gate-a-run7-findings>. Every mapped folder in this VM --
# C:\CivicCastPayload (the ~21 GB kit the installer reads),
# C:\CivicCastHostStore (the install target it writes), and
# C:\CivicCastOutput (this shipper's destination) -- rides the same Windows
# Sandbox VSMB transport. Run7 measured what a 25-second tick costs the
# other two while the installer is moving tens of GB across them. Against
# three pre-shipper runs whose CPU/local-disk-bound steps are flat to the
# second (vc-redist 4m04/4m04/4m04 -> 4m05; d4-provision 25s/25s/28s ->
# 28s), every VSMB-crossing installer step in run7 slowed down:
#
#   stage-packs                6m39 / 6m47 / 7m21  ->  11m26   (1.6x)
#   d2-verify-server-binaries     6s /    5s /  5s  ->     21s   (4.2x)
#   d2-verify-app-payload      1m09 / 1m14 / 1m19  ->   3m16   (2.5x)
#   d4-activate-station       14m13 /14m37 /15m44  ->  35m09   (2.2x, then FAILED)
#
# So while the installer runs, the shipper drops to $QuiesceIntervalSeconds
# (default 300). The driver writes _SHIPPER-QUIESCE.marker before launching
# the installer and removes it after. The marker carries its own expiry so a
# lost removal degrades to "back to the fast tick", never to "shipping
# silently stopped for the rest of the run". 300s still sits far inside
# Host-Launch-Sandbox-Test.ps1's 15-minute quiet-share bound, so liveness is
# preserved throughout -- and the install phase produces almost no evidence
# to ship anyway (markers and INSTALL-RESULT.txt, nothing more).
#
# The mirror is ADDITIVE (robocopy /E, never /MIR): the host owns files in
# that folder too (.gitkeep, _HOST_LAUNCHED.marker, SOAK_MINUTES.txt, and
# the launcher's own HOST-QUIET-SHARE.txt), and a purge would delete them.
# The one retraction the harness genuinely needs -- a watchdog timeout file
# that a genuine completion later supersedes -- is handled by an explicit,
# named retraction list instead.

# Spawn the watchdog now, as early as possible, so it bounds the ENTIRE run
# (installer through T5 soak) -- not just the parts of the script written
# after it. Two independent triggers, both handled by this ONE separate
# process (still not Start-Job -- see below):
#   (1) OVERALL bound: if DONE.json still does not exist $MaxScriptMinutes
#       minutes from now, write WATCHDOG-TIMEOUT.txt + a placeholder
#       DONE.json so Host-Launch-Sandbox-Test.ps1's poll loop can never
#       wait on a zombie in-sandbox script forever.
#   (2) STALENESS bound, added after the 8579e66-run4 evidence: run #4
#       reached 'station-diag-captured-after-t3t5' at 11:52:11Z and then
#       never advanced -- 'install-progress-log-copied' (the very next
#       step, block 6 below) never arrived in 6+ minutes, with no
#       DONE.json, and a coarse whole-script deadline was far too blunt a
#       bound to catch that kind of late-stage stall promptly.
#
# ARMING FIX <gate-a-mapped-folder-stalls>. The first version of trigger
# (2) armed by string-matching the CURRENT value of
# summary.json.last_completed_step against three names ('runtime-check-*',
# 't3t5-skipped-station-down', 't5-soak-complete') while polling every 30s.
# On run6 that never armed, so only the coarse overall bound fired -- 47
# minutes late. The reason is a race that was guaranteed to lose, not bad
# luck: every one of those three names is a MOMENTARY value. Run6's
# 'runtime-check-*' steps occupied summary.json from 22:29:57 to 22:29:58
# (~1s -- RUNTIME-RESULT.txt records all three surfaces answering on poll
# #1), and 't5-soak-complete' was written at ~22:54:46 and superseded by
# 'station-diag-captured-after-t3t5' at 22:54:48 (~2s). Sampling a ~3s
# total window with a 30s poll misses it roughly 9 times in 10.
#
# Two structural fixes, both applied below:
#   * ARM ON A STICKY FILE, not a transient value. The main script writes
#     _VERDICT-STAGE.marker once, at the station-up verdict, and never
#     removes it. Test-Path cannot be raced by a coarse poller. The step-
#     name predicate is kept as a redundant second arming path (and
#     widened to every post-verdict step name), never as the only one.
#   * STALL ON A MONOTONIC COUNTER, not name equality. summary.json now
#     carries step_seq, incremented on every Save-Summary. Two different
#     steps can share a name; step_seq cannot repeat, so "progress
#     stopped" is now an unambiguous observation rather than an inference
#     from string equality.
#
# Both this watchdog's reads (summary.json) and its writes (STALL-TIMEOUT
# .txt, WATCHDOG-TIMEOUT.txt, DONE.json) are against the LOCAL $OutDir. In
# run6 this watchdog wrote successfully to the mapped folder while the main
# script was wedged on it, which is lucky, not designed: had its own
# summary.json read wedged instead, nothing at all would have fired.
#
# Deliberately NOT implemented with Start-Job -- service.py's own history
# (see comment near the Get-WinEvent call further down) documents a real
# System.OutOfMemoryException hit loading PSWorkflow/PSScheduledJob module
# type data the moment Start-Job was invoked under this VM's memory
# pressure, so the watchdog is a genuinely separate powershell.exe process
# (Start-Process) instead -- it never touches the job-scheduling subsystem.

      the previous change's liveness line gave, and it was enough to find the

      This narrows the next one without a debugger, using nothing that
      Windows PowerShell 5.1 lacks:

        1. A CPU DELTA over a fixed interval. One cumulative CPU number cannot
           distinguish "spinning right now" from "burned CPU earlier and is
           now blocked". Two samples can, and that is the single most useful
           bit for choosing where to look.
        2. A bounded MiniDump via rundll32 comsvcs.dll, written to $env:TEMP
           and NEVER to the shipped evidence directory -- a full dump of the
           8.3 GB process this was written for would be 8.3 GB. Only the path
           and size are recorded. Guarded by a working-set cap so it is
           skipped exactly when it would be ruinous, and by its own timeout.

      Returns a single line. Never throws.

# SUMMARY SERIALIZATION SAFETY <gate-a-summary-json-explosion>
#
# THE BUG THIS EXISTS FOR. Five Gate A runs (4, 6, 7, and both candidate-#11
# runs) stopped advancing at the first Save-Summary after
# install_progress_log_tail was assigned. The liveness instrument added in the
# previous change finally answered what was happening:
#
#   driver_process_alive=true driver_cpu_seconds=449.5 driver_working_set_mb=8318.2
#
# Alive, CPU-hot, 8.3 GB resident in a 16 GB VM. Not blocked I/O -- a
# serializer explosion.
#
# Get-Content does not emit plain strings. It emits strings DECORATED with
# NoteProperties: PSPath, PSParentPath, PSChildName, PSDrive, PSProvider,
# ReadCount. PSProvider is a ProviderInfo whose .Drives is a collection of
# PSDriveInfo, and each PSDriveInfo has a .Provider back-reference to that same
# ProviderInfo -- a cycle. ConvertTo-Json walks NoteProperties, so -Depth N
# walks that cycle N levels deep and expands combinatorially.
#
# Measured on this host, ONE Get-Content line inside a hashtable:
#
#   -Depth 3 ->      1,889 json chars
#   -Depth 4 ->     32,936
#   -Depth 5 ->    447,193
#   -Depth 6 ->  3,852,872
#   -Depth 7 -> 98,197,802  (11.2 seconds)
#   -Depth 8 -> never completed; killed at 180s having reached 4 GB / 178s CPU
#
# The driver serialized EIGHTY such lines at -Depth 8. 8.3 GB and 449.5s of
# CPU is exactly what that costs.
#
# The same 80 lines as PLAIN strings at the same -Depth 8: 5,314 chars, 30 ms.
#
# Two independent defences, because either alone would have been enough to
# prevent this and neither alone is enough to prevent the next one:
#   (1) Sanitize at the boundary -- ConvertTo-PlainForSummary below strips
#       PSObject decoration off everything before it is serialized, so a
#       decorated value can no longer reach ConvertTo-Json at all.
#   (2) Serialize at the depth the data actually needs (6), not 8. The
#       deepest real member is install_tree_top_levels: summary -> array ->
#       entry -> children -> string = 5. Depth is a blast-radius multiplier
#       for exactly this class of bug.

# Save-Summary 'station-diag-captured-after-t3t5' and Save-Summary
# 'install-progress-log-copied'. Runs 4, 6 and 7 all stopped advancing
# inside exactly that window, and because the two Save-Summary calls were
# the only instrumentation, all three post-mortems can localise the stall to
# a WINDOW and none of them can name the statement. Run7 narrows it further
# but still not to one op: the complete 6844-byte copy reached the host, so
# the Copy-Item's handle closed, which leaves the tail read and the step
# write -- and on this host, against run7's own file, both measure in single
# -digit milliseconds.
#
# Two changes, both of which stand regardless of which op it turns out to be:
#   (1) RELOCATE: the primary call site is now right after the installer
#       returns, out of the finalization path entirely.
#   (2) INSTRUMENT: every statement gets its own step, so the next
#       occurrence names the operation instead of a window. That is the
#       instrument the three previous post-mortems did not have.
#
# Also: ONE forward read replaces the old copy-then-re-read-with-Tail. The
# old shape wrote the file and immediately read it back on the Sandbox's
# virtualized/differencing C:, which this file's own 2026-08-17 note already
# flags as a place where ordinary operations can take minutes. Reading the
# source once into memory, writing it out, and slicing the tail in memory

# BOUNDED PROBE <gate-a-hoststore-wedge>
#
# `Invoke-BoundedProcess` above bounds an external command. This bounds a
# piece of OUR OWN logic: it ships the script text to a throwaway
# powershell.exe, hands it arguments and a result path as files (no quoting
# games), waits with a timeout, and reads the JSON back. On timeout the child
# is killed and the caller gets $null plus a recorded note.
#
# Why this exists rather than just calling the code inline: `C:\CivicCastHostStore`
# is a read-write mapped folder AND the install target -- 10,683 files and
# 1,264 directories live there after a successful install, and the installer's
# own final step spent three minutes merely measuring that tree. Every
# remaining synchronous read of it from the driver's single thread is an
# unbounded call against a share the driver does not control, which is the
# exact shape of failure this harness has hit four times.
#
# Rejected alternative, for the record: moving the install target to a LOCAL
# directory (C:\CivicCastLocalInstall) would remove the dependency outright
# and was the tidier-sounding option. It is not viable, and the reason is
# already documented in this file -- the `/D=C:\CivicCastHostStore\install`
# comment records that staging the packs locally "blew past the Sandbox's
# virtual disk (os error 112 'not enough space') during station-pack cache",
# because the install is ~12 GB and activation stages ~40 GB of models on top
# of a ~40 GB virtual C:. That same comment also records that activation
# "REFUSES junction/symlink install-roots", so the obvious dodge is closed
# too. Run-GateA.ps1's fresh-install guarantee (it resets hoststore\ before
# every run) and gate_a_verdict.py's install/activation checks both read that
# tree from the host as well. Bounding the accesses is the option that
# survives all three constraints.

# HARDENED 2026-08-18 -- helpers added for T2 (render assert), T3 (real
# authenticated content loop), and T4 (product-engine egress) upgrades.
# audit findings this section addresses:
#   QA-F1: the old T2 pass criterion was "200 status + >0 bytes", which is
#          true for the served SPA shell whether or not the SPA ever mounts.
#          Test-RenderAssert below drives real headless Edge and requires
#          the DOM to grow far past the raw shell AND contain real UI copy.
#   QA-F2: the old T4 "egress" proof piped raw ffmpeg straight at a UDP
#          port -- it proved ffmpeg works, not that CivicCast's own egress
#          engine (config -> daemon -> sink) works. The T4 section now
#          attempts to drive that engine through its real staff API first
#          and only falls back to the synthetic-ffmpeg proof, labeled
#          PASS_FFMPEG_FALLBACK (never plain PASS), if the API path is
#          genuinely blocked.
#   T3:    a real authenticated content loop -- loopback first-admin -> staff
#          bearer token -> generate/upload/package/publish an asset ->
#          prove it on the public surface -> prove offline captions land.
#
# All HTTP calls in these helpers go through Invoke-CivicCastApi so every
# step logs method/url/status, and any >=400 response has its body
# captured -- consistent with this file's existing philosophy of leaving a
# forensic trail even when a step fails, rather than just failing silently.
