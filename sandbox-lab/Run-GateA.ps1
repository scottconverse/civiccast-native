# Run-GateA.ps1 -- host orchestrator for Gate A, the automated station-
# acceptance release gate. Runs ON THE HOST (not in Sandbox).
#
# What it does, in order:
#   1. Resolve the candidate kit -- either download it via `gh run download`
#      (-RunId, a single throttled stream -- fine for manual/local use) or
#      use an already-extracted directory (-KitDir, the shape
#      gate-a-station-acceptance.yml hands in after its own parallel,
#      chunked actions/download-artifact@v4 fetch -- see that workflow's
#      header for why the workflow no longer calls -RunId itself).
#      With -KitDir, -SourceSha and -RunId are accepted as optional metadata
#      so the verdict JSON still carries the candidate sha and run id even
#      though this script did not do the resolving itself.
#   2. Validate the kit layout (glob for the installer, don't assume a name;
#      confirm the station bundle is present).
#   3. Point sandbox-lab\kit-download at the resolved kit via an NTFS
#      directory junction (never a copy -- the assembled kit is ~20+ GB;
#      see native-beta-candidate-artifacts.yml's own header for why these
#      artifacts are that large).
#   4. Reset hoststore\ (every gate run is a FRESH install -- a stale
#      persistent install directory would silently skip install evidence).
#   5. Run Host-Launch-Sandbox-Test.ps1, which itself clears output\, writes
#      SOAK_MINUTES.txt, renders the .wsb from its template, launches the
#      Sandbox, polls for the authoritative DONE.json completion signal, and
#      (on the normal-completion path only) drains its own teardown -- waits,
#      bounded, for the VM and its mapped-folder handles to actually release
#      before returning, so a following Checkout step does not hit EBUSY on a
#      still-tearing-down VM. See docs/ops/gate-a.md, "Teardown drain".
#   6. Judge the result with scripts/gate_a_verdict.py (fail-closed).
#   7. Copy output\ to evidence\<source_sha>\<utc-timestamp>\ regardless of
#      verdict -- a FAIL needs its evidence preserved at least as much as a
#      PASS does.
#   8. Print the verdict and exit 0 (PASS), 1 (FAIL), or 2 (not a
#      station-acceptance finding at all -- BUSY because Windows Sandbox
#      stayed occupied by another process and this run never launched, a
#      quiet/wedged mapped output folder mid-run, a plain timeout, no VM, a
#      missing prerequisite, or a bad kit layout). None of those is ever
#      reported as a FAIL: a run whose evidence never reached the host
#      supports no conclusion about the product at all.
#
# Requires on PATH: gh (GitHub CLI, only for -RunId), uv (for the Python
# judge). Must run on a Windows host with the Windows Sandbox feature
# enabled -- see docs/ops/gate-a.md for the runner setup
# (sandbox-lab/runner/Install-GateARunner.ps1).

#         of junctioning the whole directory -- Host-Launch-Sandbox-Test.ps1
#         resolves the OUTER MappedFolder HostFolder through reparse points
