# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

This repository begins on 2026-08-20 with the native-Windows product extracted
from [`scottconverse/civiccast`](https://github.com/scottconverse/civiccast) at
**fresh history**. Entries before that date live in that repository's own
CHANGELOG; nothing was deleted there. See [`BRANCHES.md`](BRANCHES.md) for what
came across and what deliberately did not.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **This repository.** 2,090 files, ~24 MB, copied from the native-Windows
  release line. The old (private, not archived) repository's 286 MB of
  packed history — WSL-era churn plus roughly 640 MB of historical Git-LFS
  tester binaries — does not transfer, by construction.
- `docs/design/` — six design records (supervisor, installer lifecycle,
  migration contract, dual-runtime guard, native-beta recovery, the sub-300 MB
  bootstrap plan) hand-carried out of the otherwise-scratch `.agent-runs/` tree.
- `docs/evidence/` — the proof documents `docs/claims/claims.yaml` binds, also
  rescued from `.agent-runs/`.
- `scripts/wp5_lifecycle_driver.py` — the WP-5 clean-venue lifecycle proof
  driver, previously marooned in `.agent-runs/` and imported by
  `tests/native/test_wp5_lifecycle_driver.py`.
- `scripts/policy/check_workflow_timeouts.py` — fails the build when a workflow
  job declares no `timeout-minutes` (GitHub's default is 360) or exceeds the
  180-minute cap without a written exemption.

### Removed

- **The WSL2/Ubuntu bootstrap lane, finished.** CLAUDE.md and BRANCHES.md
  already declared the WSL2 lane retired (2026-08-19) and "not present
  here"; this cleared out the leftover code, tests, and documentation that
  still built, tested, or described it as if it were.
  - `civiccast/apps/installer/src-tauri/src/main.rs`: the entire WSL2/Ubuntu
    installer lane — `is_wsl_bootstrap_lane` and its dispatch branch, the
    `StartupBranch` native-vs-WSL split (collapsed to native-only, since
    every Windows control plane this binary produces IS the native one),
    the WSL2/Ubuntu feature-enable and provisioning pipeline
    (`launch_wsl_ubuntu_install`, `install_wsl_ubuntu_for_current_user`,
    `run_wsl_health_sequence`), and the headless runtime-bootstrap pipeline
    built around the already-deleted `headless-bootstrap.ps1` resource
    script (`run_headless_bootstrap`,
    `bootstrap_civiccast_runtime[_headless]/_via_script`, the
    `--civiccast-bootstrap-unattended` CLI flag). ~2,530 net lines removed.
    Two real leftover bugs fixed in the same pass, not just dead code: the
    "Open installer log" button pointed at two files that no longer exist
    (now points at the native runtime host's own `runtime-host.log`), and
    the "repair"/"retry"/"continue" installer actions on the runtime-family
    lanes called into the deleted headless-bootstrap pipeline (now start
    and re-verify the native runtime host process, reusing the same
    primitives the startup path already used). The runtime-host watchdog
    (`run_civiccast_runtime_host`, `--civiccast-runtime-host`) no longer
    spawns or monitors a companion `wsl.exe` process or shells into a WSL
    distro to restart `civiccast.service` — `CivicCastSupervisor` is a real
    Windows service with its own SCM restart-on-failure actions, so the
    watchdog's job for native is honest health observation, not a second
    recovery path.
  - `civiccast/apps/installer/src-tauri/nsis-hooks.nsh` — the retired WSL2
    product's NSIS hook file (distro autostart/terminate/unregister). The
    base `tauri.conf.json` no longer declares `installerHooks` referencing
    it; nothing in this repository's build scripts or CI ever built that
    base config directly (they always pass
    `--config tauri.native.conf.json`), so nothing that ships changed.
  - The installer frontend's dead WSL2 lane UI: `wsl-affordances.ts`
    (renamed `lane-affordances.ts` with the WSL predicates removed — the
    prior retirement pass had already hardcoded them to always return
    `false` rather than deleting the branches that read them),
    `keyboard-activation.ts`/`.test.ts` (its entire purpose was arming a
    shortcut on the WSL bootstrap lane, always-false and therefore dead),
    `progress-visual.ts`'s `isWindowsBootstrapProgress`/
    `windowsBootstrapProgressIsIndeterminate`, `installer-transition.ts`'s
    `markWindowsBootstrapResultPending`, and every WSL-only branch in
    `App.tsx` (the `WindowsSetupActivity` component, the WSL half of
    `continueLane`, the dead keyboard-shortcut effect).
  - `civiccast.installer.platform`/`civiccast.installer.service` (Python):
    the *backend* twin of the same leftover, and a live one —
    `/api/staff/installer/summary` (the endpoint the installer frontend
    actually polls) could still produce `platform="windows-wsl2"` and "Set
    up Windows helper" wording under real, reachable conditions, not just
    from a legacy state file. `PlatformBootstrapPlan`'s `os_family` no
    longer accepts `"windows"` (Windows readiness is decided entirely by
    this process's own native-station activation signals now); the
    Windows-drive-to-WSL-mount path translation in
    `_backup_destination_path` is gone; the support bundle's log collector
    no longer looks for `bootstrap-wsl2-ubuntu.log` under
    `%LOCALAPPDATA%\CivicCast` (a path nothing writes to anymore) and now
    reads the native runtime host's own log instead.
  - `civiccast/installer/contribution_install.py`: coturn's Windows
    guidance no longer says "run it under WSL" — coturn has no native
    Windows build, so it is now a documented **external** TURN server
    (`CIVICCAST_TURN_HOST`/`CIVICCAST_TURN_PORT` point at one;
    `CIVICCAST_COTURN_COMMAND` stays unset).
  - `scripts/policy/check_release_artifacts.py`'s cross-platform installer
    policy check had the WSL retirement backwards: it FAILED any doc that
    claimed "native windows service" or "without wsl2", instructing the
    author to rewrite Windows claims as WSL2-only bootstrap support. It now
    rejects the opposite — a doc that still claims the Windows installer
    requires or bootstraps WSL2. Running the corrected check immediately
    surfaced a real violation: `INSTALL-WINDOWS.md` was written entirely
    for "the public WSL2 line (`main`, `v1.0.0-rc18`)" and linked to three
    release-verification docs and a GitHub release page that belong to the
    old, private `scottconverse/civiccast` repository and do not exist or
    resolve here. Marked the WSL2-line content historical (kept, not
    deleted — rewriting a historical beta's own record would be
    revisionist) and did the same for `docs/installer/
    cross-platform-installer.md`, `docs/installer/beta-tester-handoff.md`,
    and `docs/adoption/early-adopter-quickstart.md`.
  - `tests/policy/test_windows_wsl_bootstrap_script.py` (deleted) and
    `tests/installer/test_uninstall_residuals.py` (deleted): of the former's
    ~45 tests, 32 tested the deleted WSL2 pipeline or NSIS macros; the
    other ~13 tested genuinely shared infrastructure (IPC capability,
    blocking-pool dispatch, the local installer-state read/write path) and
    were carried into the newly added
    `tests/policy/test_native_installer_runtime_infra.py`. The latter's
    tests entirely exercised the deleted `nsis-hooks.nsh` macro and a
    disposable WSL clean-machine verifier; the native hooks file
    (`nsis-hooks-bootstrap.nsh`) already has its own dedicated coverage in
    `tests/installer/test_nsis_bootstrap_hooks.py`.
  - `tests/policy/test_native_installer_identity.py`: replaced its
    "native and WSL product identities are disjoint" assertions (moot once
    there is only one product) with a positive assertion that the native
    hooks file is the only one wired and the base config declares no
    `installerHooks` of its own.
  - `tests/installer/test_platform_bootstrap.py`: rewritten to cover only
    Linux/macOS — one deleted test asserted that a *native* Windows service
    plan gets **rejected**, the exact opposite of current reality.
  - Stale "WSL2 is the primary/current/public" framing corrected in
    `README.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `FAQ.md`, `SUPPORT.md`,
    `CONTRIBUTING.md` (its base-branch instruction pointed contributors at
    a `release/native-beta-1.0.0-beta.1-rc1` branch that does not exist in
    this repository), `SECURITY.md`, `CLAUDE.md` (the old repository is
    private, not archived — two instances), and
    `civiccast/platform/hardware.py`'s `OSKind` doc (cited the
    now-superseded ADR-0003 and called native Windows "not a supported
    deployment"). `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug-report.yml`'s deployment
    dropdown no longer offers "Windows 11 + WSL2 (Ubuntu 24.04)" or
    "Docker" as options.
  - `civiccast/native/*` and `civiccast_native_uninstall.rs`'s
    `native`/`wsl`/`absent` `ActiveRuntime` selector, cutover/rollback
    commands, and dual-runtime start guard are **unchanged, deliberately**.
    This is real coexistence-safety logic for a machine that may still
    carry a live WSL CivicCast install or registry ownership marker from
    before the retirement — it protects against a native install/repair
    silently clobbering that other product's ownership state, which is a
    different concern from installing or running CivicCast on WSL.

### Changed

- **Egress default engine flipped to GStreamer (S15).** `civiccast/egress/engine_select.py`'s
  `_DEFAULT` moves from `"ffmpeg-concat"` to `"gstreamer"` -- an unset
  `CIVICCAST_EGRESS_ENGINE` now selects the persistent-pipeline GStreamer engine,
  matching the native station bootstrap's own runtime contract
  (`civiccast/native/station_runtime.py`'s `EXPECTED_RUNTIME_CONTRACT`) and fixing
  the class of bug that continuity bug #151 belonged to (per-segment ffmpeg
  relaunches resetting the MPEG-TS continuity counter) for every caller that
  builds an `EncoderStrategy` without an explicit engine. `CIVICCAST_EGRESS_ENGINE=
  ffmpeg-concat` remains a live, fully-supported override for deployments that
  still need the legacy engine; the GStreamer -> self-repair -> FFmpeg ->
  fallback-slate degraded-mode chain (`station_runtime._resolve_gstreamer_egress_
  environment`, `egress.daemon.EgressDaemon`) is unchanged. Also fixes a latent
  edge case surfaced while flipping the default: a present-but-blank
  `CIVICCAST_EGRESS_ENGINE=` now resolves to the same engine as an unset one,
  instead of silently pinning ffmpeg-concat via its old membership in
  `_FFMPEG_ALIASES`.
- **Windows-only by decision.** No `docker/`, no systemd units, no WSL2 install
  target, no Linux GStreamer container build. The native product uses the
  pinned `gstreamer-*==1.28.5` PyPI wheels.
- `civiccast/egress/{service_unit,recovery,soak}.py` and the `.deb`/`.rpm`
  builders are gone, with `civiccast/cli.py`'s `egress enable` and
  `egress recovery-proof` subcommands. **`egress recovery-proof` was an
  operator-visible command** — it measured egress recovery against a systemd
  unit; the native equivalent is the supervisor plus
  `civiccast/native/gstreamer_repair.py`.
- Type checking (`ci-lint`) runs on `windows-latest`. The same commit reports
  112 mypy errors on Linux and 23 on Windows; the extra 89 are artifacts of
  checking Windows-only code on a platform this product never runs on.
- Artifact retention is **1 day** everywhere, at both the workflow and
  repository level.

### Fixed

- **nanoid 3.3.17 → 3.3.18** (GHSA-2v37-7h3g-55p8, high) in both the operator
  console and the public portal.
- **pypdf 6.14.2 → 6.16.1** (PYSEC-2026-3655, PYSEC-2026-3656) — resource
  exhaustion reachable through PDF parsing, which matters because this product
  ingests operator- and contributor-supplied agenda PDFs.
- Non-HTTP control-plane URLs are refused before `urlopen`. The base is
  operator-overridable via `CIVICCAST_CONTROL_PLANE_URL`, so a mis-set value
  could turn a health probe into a local file read whose contents were then
  parsed as a health body.
- Release signing derives its cosign certificate identity from
  `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`. It was hard-coded to the old (private, not archived)
  repository, so verification would have rejected this repository's own
  signatures.
- The GStreamer playout engine's module docstrings no longer claim
  "WSL/Linux-only" — the Windows named-pipe transport ships and its suite runs
  natively.
- **Station timezone now reaches the running service (M3).** First-admin
  setup persisted the operator's chosen `station_timezone` into station-state
  JSON, but nothing propagated it to the running service — S18 daypart
  auto-scheduling silently ran on UTC for every station, corrupting
  scheduling, as-run logs, and program guides for any station not in UTC.
  `civiccast/app.py`'s `_station_tz()` now reads the persisted value (via the
  new `civiccast.installer.station_state.read_station_timezone()`) when
  `CIVICCAST_STATION_TZ` is unset; the env var still works as an explicit
  override.
- **C1 — a fresh station install could never call for help.**
  `civiccast/alerting/evaluator.py`'s dispatch path silently `return`ed with
  no record at all when an `AlertRule` had zero live channels — the exact
  state every migration-`0039`-seeded default rule ships in (an install
  cannot fabricate operator SMTP/SMS/webhook credentials). The alert event
  itself still fired, but the delivery attempt vanished without a trace: no
  suppressed-delivery row, nothing for the deliveries drawer to show, no way
  to tell "nowhere to send it" from "alerting is broken." Fixed to log a
  visible suppressed `AlertEventDelivery` on the no-channel gap (fire and
  resolve paths), per spec §6.2's "never a silent drop" contract.

### Known gaps

- No per-PR gate on `civiccast/egress/gst/*`. The suite runs natively but needs
  a provisioned runtime tree (`CIVICCAST_GSTREAMER_RUNTIME_ROOT`), which CI does
  not build yet.
- The packager → HLS → real-browser playback path lost its automated gate with
  the Docker cleanroom. The Windows Sandbox harness covers more, on real
  Windows, but is not wired as a CI gate here.
- The Tauri installer still carries an inert WSL2 bootstrap branch in
  `src-tauri/src/main.rs`. It never fires on a native station; removing it is
  tracked separately.

## [1.0.0-rc18] - 2026-08-02

Inherited release identity, recorded here because `civiccast/_version.py` and
this repository's release-identity checks still track it.

`v1.0.0-rc18` is the **WSL line's** published beta. It was built, released and
documented in `scottconverse/civiccast`, not here, and this repository does not
produce it. Its full entry is in that repository's CHANGELOG.

The native product line carries its own separate version in
`civiccast/_native_version.py` — currently `1.0.0-beta.1`, owner-held and
unpublished. Whether a native-only repository should keep tracking the retired
line's identity at all is an open decision for the owner; until it is made,
both are recorded honestly rather than one being quietly retyped as the other.
