# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

This repository begins on 2026-08-20 with the native-Windows product extracted
from [`scottconverse/civiccast`](https://github.com/scottconverse/civiccast) at
**fresh history**. Entries before that date live in that repository's own
CHANGELOG; nothing was deleted there. See [`BRANCHES.md`](BRANCHES.md) for what
came across and what deliberately did not.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **This repository.** 2,090 files, ~24 MB, copied from the native-Windows
  release line. The archived repository's 286 MB of packed history — WSL-era
  churn plus roughly 640 MB of historical Git-LFS tester binaries — does not
  transfer, by construction.
- `docs/design/` — six design records (supervisor, installer lifecycle,
  migration contract, dual-runtime guard, native-beta recovery, the sub-300 MB
  bootstrap plan) hand-carried out of the otherwise-scratch `.agent-runs/` tree.
- `docs/evidence/` — the proof documents `docs/claims/claims.yaml` binds, also
  rescued from `.agent-runs/`.
- `scripts/wp5_lifecycle_driver.py` — the WP-5 clean-venue lifecycle proof
  driver, previously marooned in `.agent-runs/` and imported by
  `tests/native/test_wp5_lifecycle_driver.py`.
- `scripts/policy/check_workflow_timeouts.py` — fails the build when a workflow
  job declares no `timeout-minutes` (GitHub's default is 360) or exceeds the
  180-minute cap without a written exemption.

### Changed

- **Windows-only by decision.** No `docker/`, no systemd units, no WSL2 install
  target, no Linux GStreamer container build. The native product uses the
  pinned `gstreamer-*==1.28.5` PyPI wheels.
- `civiccast/egress/{service_unit,recovery,soak}.py` and the `.deb`/`.rpm`
  builders are gone, with `civiccast/cli.py`'s `egress enable` and
  `egress recovery-proof` subcommands. **`egress recovery-proof` was an
  operator-visible command** — it measured egress recovery against a systemd
  unit; the native equivalent is the supervisor plus
  `civiccast/native/gstreamer_repair.py`.
- Type checking (`ci-lint`) runs on `windows-latest`. The same commit reports
  112 mypy errors on Linux and 23 on Windows; the extra 89 are artifacts of
  checking Windows-only code on a platform this product never runs on.
- Artifact retention is **1 day** everywhere, at both the workflow and
  repository level.

### Fixed

- **nanoid 3.3.17 → 3.3.18** (GHSA-2v37-7h3g-55p8, high) in both the operator
  console and the public portal.
- **pypdf 6.14.2 → 6.16.1** (PYSEC-2026-3655, PYSEC-2026-3656) — resource
  exhaustion reachable through PDF parsing, which matters because this product
  ingests operator- and contributor-supplied agenda PDFs.
- Non-HTTP control-plane URLs are refused before `urlopen`. The base is
  operator-overridable via `CIVICCAST_CONTROL_PLANE_URL`, so a mis-set value
  could turn a health probe into a local file read whose contents were then
  parsed as a health body.
- Release signing derives its cosign certificate identity from
  `GITHUB_REPOSITORY`. It was hard-coded to the archived repository, so
  verification would have rejected this repository's own signatures.
- The GStreamer playout engine's module docstrings no longer claim
  "WSL/Linux-only" — the Windows named-pipe transport ships and its suite runs
  natively.

### Known gaps

- No per-PR gate on `civiccast/egress/gst/*`. The suite runs natively but needs
  a provisioned runtime tree (`CIVICCAST_GSTREAMER_RUNTIME_ROOT`), which CI does
  not build yet.
- The packager → HLS → real-browser playback path lost its automated gate with
  the Docker cleanroom. The Windows Sandbox harness covers more, on real
  Windows, but is not wired as a CI gate here.
- The Tauri installer still carries an inert WSL2 bootstrap branch in
  `src-tauri/src/main.rs`. It never fires on a native station; removing it is
  tracked separately.

## [1.0.0-rc18] - 2026-08-02

Inherited release identity, recorded here because `civiccast/_version.py` and
this repository's release-identity checks still track it.

`v1.0.0-rc18` is the **WSL line's** published beta. It was built, released and
documented in `scottconverse/civiccast`, not here, and this repository does not
produce it. Its full entry is in that repository's CHANGELOG.

The native product line carries its own separate version in
`civiccast/_native_version.py` — currently `1.0.0-beta.1`, owner-held and
unpublished. Whether a native-only repository should keep tracking the retired
line's identity at all is an open decision for the owner; until it is made,
both are recorded honestly rather than one being quietly retyped as the other.
